        "text": "#68130 I've started writing this confession several times and stopped myself, because I know there's no real point to it, but I guess I just want to say these things in whatever way I can. I actually fell in love, I think for the very first time. Admittedly it's not real love, like when you totally surrender to the vulnerability of it because it's reciprocal, and might just be everything it could ever be. It's pretty obvious she's not interested in me. I know I'm lucky just b...ecause I can even be so delusional as to think that she might be interested - that I might be in her league. However close I might be to her feeling the same way about me, just the fact that I can have these daydreams and think they could come true is already a nice thing - I remember growing up and thinking I wouldn't be good enough for anyone at all, so things really could be a whole lot worse. But I've had her on my mind for such a long time, because this girl is so beautiful in every way, and I don't remember feeling quite like this about anyone for the longest time. I've thought of a million compliments for her, and my heart actually aches sometimes when I think about her. She has such a pretty laugh, and she's so graceful, so feminine, and so driven too, a really strong person and yet totally disarming in how beautiful she is. I mean, she's gorgeous, but it's her personality that makes her totally radiant. I'm amazed by how hard it is for me to accept reality when I want something this much. Mostly I'm happy to have this aching feeling though, to know what it's like to really feel so much tenderness for someone. It puts things into perspective, and gives me a little glimpse of the beautiful emotions that I could someday get lost in. ",

It isn't like I sleep with someone new every weekend or something (not that there is anything wrong with it), I have sex once every few months when single and usually takes going on a lot of dates.

I know it was my fault when I asked you out but when you said no, I know you meant it. Yeah it took me a minute to get over, but I never asked you out again or tried to pressure you in any way. But you looked at me like I\u2019m a womanizing predator, and it hurts me that you think I\u2019m capable of such despicable things such as emotional manipulation. If you just fucking talked to me about it instead of sweeping it under the rug until it was convenient for you, I would have took it to heart and maybe done something about it. I can\u2019t change or correct my flaws if you don\u2019t fucking tell me and act like everything is ok. Thanks for dragging my self esteem, reputation, and mental state through the mud.",

It\u2019s important to think ...about why you want to engage with certain relationships with other people, your expectations in doing so and what so far you have found valuable. I recently found that my expectations were not unreasonable but beyond a certain friend group who honestly had very superficial bonds that it was difficult to engage beyond the ingroup\u2019s specific interests and I found very little valuable from this group compared to other relationships. So I chose to disengage with interacting seriously this group, choosing to spend my time with other friends who I found more fulfilling and valuable. It\u2019s important to gauge your expectations and efforts, but it is a two way road. You cannot make people who don\u2019t care about you, to care, but you can always find people who will treat you better. Sometimes it\u2019s better to just move on. ",

In other words: Live in the moment because the decisive actions you take now will have the strongest impact on where you end up down the road. Accept and embrace the things that you can't change and rather than dwelling on them, plan around them. Never lose sight of your dreams and look forward to moving towards them. Lastly, while you shouldn't spend too much time thinking on the past, reflection is essential. This goes both ways. Honestly evaluate what you could have done differently but don't take for granted what you've accomplished already. We're here after all so you must have done something right. Believe in yourselves, this world is ours!",

(also gentle reminder to tell the people that you care about that you do care about them <3 ) ",

        "text": "#68058 Are you someone whose friends always seem to exclude you from things? Have you ever thought about why they don't invite you? People don't do things without a reason. There are really only two scenarios, with two clear courses of action to take. The first scenario is that this friend group is toxic and mean-spirited and exclude people from things for selfish/immature reasons that would persist regardless of your character. You should not be sad that they excluded you. I...n fact, you should be thanking your lucky stars that you dodged an entire hailstorm of bullets, and go and find some better friends. The second scenario is that there is nothing obviously wrong with the friend group. They are relatively decent people, and they get along with each other fine and hang out all the time, just not with you. Have you really, deeply thought about why this might be? Think about it - why would an entire friend group exclude someone who is kind and fun to be around? Would *you* want to avoid someone who was kind and fun to be around? People do not do things (or consistently \"forget\" to invite someone) for no reason - there's ALWAYS a reason. Thus the only possibility is that you are unkind or unpleasant to be around, or both (usually there is a strong correlation between these traits). In this case, you should not find it unreasonable that your so-called friends don't include you in things (since you'd probably do the same thing to someone you didn't like, wouldn't you?). Instead, if your friend group is a group that you care about and want to keep your connections with, you should try to become a kinder and more pleasant person that people would naturally want to hang out with - you can't really force anyone to want to be with you. It may take some time for them to notice, so you will need to be patient - of course, there is also no guarantee that they'll ever notice, but it's not like you've lost anything by becoming a kinder person. The other possibility (and by far the easiest thing for you to do) is that you don't change at all - in this case, you should be prepared to continue being excluded from things, and you should no longer be upset about it - after all, it's your choice. Tl;dr - if none of your friends want to hang out with you, either your friends all have problems, or you have problems. If your friends all have problems, then find better friends. If you have problems, then be a better person. Some notes: I've noticed that for a great deal of people (especially for people who post complaints on this page), whenever something doesn't go their way, they immediately think that it's everyone's problem but their own. This is a mindset that doesn't promote introspection or self-improvement, displays a lack of wisdom, and leads to things like MIT Confessions posts about problems that have very obvious (though not necessarily easy) solutions, if one took only a few minutes to think about it first.

Ignoring the obvious death to us lol, wouldn\u2019t we/the planet feel the change in gravitational force before we see that there is longer light from the sun? Or do forces like gravity and light just propagate at the same speed?  This has been killing me, so any answers would be appreciated!

        "text": "#68037 If we are to entertain the notion of a proclivity towards the pianoforte in conjunction with a conspicuous antipathy towards the harpsichord, we must duly appraise the inherent complexities of such a mental disposition. We may, in fact, liken such an individual to a 'forte-issimo ignoramus', whose musical faculties remain largely impervious to the delicate subtleties and intricate tonalities of the plectrum-plucked perfection. Indeed, the piano's hammers, with their bl...unt and resolute impact upon the strings, may well appear to some as the epitome of musical force, while the harpsichord's quills, with their deft and pliant touch, may seem feeble and antiquated in comparison. But it is precisely in this contrast that we discern the true value of the harpsichord, for it is an instrument that defies the commonplace and celebrates the arcane. Its otherworldly sound, with its crystalline purity and ethereal resonance, transcends the mundane and transports the listener to a realm of sheer beauty and wonder. Alas, it is a realm that remains beyond the grasp of the 'forte-issimo ignoramus', who is doomed to languish in the aural banality of the commonplace, deaf to the celestial harmonies of the harpsichord's exquisite perfection.

I know it's easy to compare your social situation to others' but there is no optimal friend count or clique. Everyone's obligations, clubs, residences, and lifestyles pull people in different directions so there is no shame in not having a tight group of peers that happen to share your circumstances. Be intentional about making time for those you enjoy being around, even if your day-...to-days are completely different. Putting in the extra effort could bring you much closer to the people who seem so far away. You can also find joy in interactions with people you may never see again; try staying present and reminding yourself that a shared human experience with acquaintances is wonderful enough. I promise that you'll settle into the social situation that's best for you, not necessarily the most aesthetic or convenient. But you will be more than okay. Be your own friend first and you'll make beautiful memories that are uniquely yours. ",

        "text": "#68013 I feel like MIT has turned me into a master of banana-eating. I have a whole technique an everything. Instead of biting off chunks of banana and getting slimy banana teeth, peel the banana inch by inch and bite-size pieces will break off cleanly. You can do this with your mouth or your fingers, if you're feeling extra fresh n fancy. I peel the banana from the \"handle\", always. This is because the peelability of the handle bit indicates banana ripeness. If you struggle,... the banana isn't ready. If it comes off too easily, the banana is overripe and not fit for immediate consumption and should be carefully carried back to the dorm for use in banana bread. Also, leaving a little bit of peel at the very end will allow you to break off the banana right before the weird hard bit at the end. I also swear by splitting the banana peel into 3 pieces, as this minimizes the extra peel strings that sometimes get stuck to the banana. I've also become a total banana snob. I now only eat perfectly yellow bananas with no green patches or spots. Sometimes if I'm feeling funky I shine a blacklight on the bananas to make sure there's no programmed cell death showing on the peel, indicating overripeness. I fear for my future when I will inevitably have to return to purchasing subpar bananas from the grocery store and suffering through green patches and dark spots on my bananas. ",

It\u2019s a shame that people are unwilling to admit fault or show humility. Especially in the world of politics, there\u2019s a weird obsession with winning and doubling down at any cost that just makes the world a more unpleasant place. Even if this post isn\u2019t directed at you, try setting aside pride next time you catch yourself slipping and apologize to someone instead of escalating the situation.

From close to the beginning defining a state of Israel was synonymous with homogenizing the region.  To this day Israel continues to build settlements in the occupied West Bank, which is illegal under the Geneva convention, but we all know that the US and other countries only give a shit if they have something strategic to gain from intervening.  Take two seconds from your day to think about how a celebration like this impacts Palestinian students at MIT. Cancel this event and don\u2019t plan a celebration for a day with such a painful, awful history.",

If there are, you'll forget to set the timer and your laundry will be there for hours and people will be sad. After the timer has been set, you can allow yourself to give up control of the laundry thread and reply to that message or continue that train of thought.",

        "text": "#67931 I know there's a huge activation energy to moving out! but consider: mit housing is NOT market price, and imo was never intended to be. essay incoming:  obviously you won't find super cheap housing right next to campus because a lot of it is mit-owned or commercial but for the cost of a tier ii single ($1450/month assuming you're here for iap), you can get a *very nice* room with 1-3 other people within 10 min by bus. for the cost of a tier ii single + dining plan ($19...00+/month during the semester) you can even get a relatively spacious studio in central/harvard and still have extra $200/month budget for food. this might not seem like a great deal but remember the 125 plan only covers an average of one meal a day, plus from personal experience you'll spend way less on uber eats since you'll have a cleaner kitchen shared with less people and you'll no longer live in a relative food desert. and if you're willing to deal with other people in a fsilg or live farther away, you can save even more.  now, why is mit housing so expensive? first, because they deal with a lot of things for you. you don't have to spend 50+ hours apartment hunting and going through a broker, or have to furnish your own room, or call or hunt down your management company every time you need something, there's a convenient atlas request system, there's security workers to make sure the building is safe and let you in when necessary, and at least in tier ii dorms most of the appliances and electric systems are reasonably updated, i.e. you might not have really sketchy electric stoves where each burner needs to be turned just so in order to actually heat up. not to mention that building services even cleans your bathrooms for you. that's a lot of people they're paying to hopefully make your life a little easier. also, housing revenue margins are fairly slim because of maintenance costs. mit estimates a total $1.5b campus maintenance backlog (> $100/sq ft), a lot of which is student housing, and they keep building new dorms precisely because so many undergrad and grad students want to live on campus these days (part of which might be 2000s-era pushback against frat and alternative cultures, but anyway). aside from space/capacity issues, you're paying for these (intended) quality of life improvements and maybe the experience of mit dorm culture? I understand it's sad to leave that behind but ultimately if you'd rather not pay the premium and are able to dedicate a bit of bandwidth each week to your housing, consider not living on campus/shouldering mit's construction burdens and finding cheaper ways to be part of the mit community.

        "text": "#67907 tldr; if your parents pay your tuition, stop repeatedly saying you are poor. There's this person who keeps on saying they are poor and that they have no money. As a FLI, when they told me this, I assumed they were on financial aid. But then this person told me they pay full tuition and their mom is a doctor (who gets paid a lot). This person cosplaying as poor isn't offensive per se, but it is rather out of touch. Just because you have a limited budget for whatever rea...son does not make it okay to try garner empathy or sympathy. You are incredibly privileged to never have been unhoused or on food stamps or worry about having enough food or paying for a bus ticket back home or helping your family financially with bills. For anyone who is in contact with their parents and whose parents are wealthy, you may have a limited budget because you don't want to depend on your parents (which is valid!). But it is incredibly tone deaf to say you are poor when in the worst case scenario, you do have some semblance of a safety net when it comes to money. Low income students don't even have that. In many cases, low income students ARE the financial safety net for their families. ",

Consider: it is very in-character for Harvard students to enforce a prescriptivist linguistic ideal and pronounce the COOP as \"co-\u00f6p\". It is simultaneously in-character for MIT students to give zero flying fucks and choose the funnier/descriptivist pronunciation, therefore leaning hard into calling it the \"coop\", like a chicken coop. To add to this point, to my knowledge, only the Harvard Square COOP has signage specificall...y outlining the \"co-\u00f6p\" pronunciation, while this specific information does not exist at any of the MIT locations. The \"co-\u00f6p\"/\"coop\" distinction will also help enforce a healthy divide between the Harvard and MIT versions of the COOP. For this reason, I will proudly continue to call it the \"coop\" and encourage my fellow MIT affiliates to do so. For any people who are affiliated with both MIT and Harvard (e.g. through grad school) I will take your pronunciation of the COOP as a sign indicating which side you hold greater allegiance for and respond accordingly.

The posters were hard to read. I greatly appreciate the dormspammer who shared them because knowledge is power but you were so right to include a trigger warning. Some of those sent me back to my own worst days where I genuinely believed that I deserved to go to Hell and that the way I loved was a ...detestable sin.  This is not about free speech. This is about understanding that posting slurs and promoting hate hurts us. You hurt us. I know that so many of the people involved were part of the communities they attacked but that doesn't make any of this okay. To quote the sign in my middle school band room: \"impact > intention.\"  I hope that the people involved learn from this. If you're reading this, know that I don't think you're a bad person. But this was a mistake, and a real, honest apology would go a long way towards healing our campus. To my friend who asked if I was okay when this first came out: thank you. That meant so much to me and I cried a little bit afterwards because I was so touched. I want to finally say that while I'm disappointed that some of us caused so much harm, I know that this is not the MIT community as a whole. Prefrosh: if you're gay or trans or mentally ill or disabled or non-White please know that you are also welcomed here. This is a negative chapter in MIT's book but it is not the whole story. MIT has problems and it is not perfect but the backlash to these posters from so many different students has given me hope. ",

There's this one class that is just absolutely destroying me, I just hope I pass, and a part of me has this baseless faith that I will because I've never failed a class before.

I am humbled and grateful to MIT for the scholarship and the fact that they are needs blind - because of MIT I am able to break the cycle of generational poverty. My dad worked at a very labor intensive job only to make minimum wage to support me and my siblings. He passed unexpectedly in a car accident last year and I never got... the chance to thank him.  My mom was my biggest supporter. She never missed a soccer game or math competition.  She saw my potential and pushed me when I needed it and was the first to tell me if I was getting off track, even if I didn't like it at the time. She never spent a dime on herself, everything was for me and my siblings. I have no doubt that I wouldn't be here without my parents and I tell my mom that every time I see her and I plan to make sure she is taken care of. ",

        "text": "#67840 TW: vague SI/depression (with positive thoughts) Took leave from MIT and it\u2019s been really tough. Things were awful at MIT, and taking leave, despite saving my life, has also made things so much worse for me in new, fucked up ways.   Especially as a financially struggling student who has an incredibly strained relationship with their family, I\u2019ve experienced a lot of new trauma and struggled to find emotionally safe housing. I don\u2019t know how to keep moving forward. And ...even in saying that, I\u2019m scared because I don\u2019t want to sound too negative and scare people who might also need to take leave to protect/replenish their well-being. Cause I believe leave can be a very empowering experience. But I feel MIT abandoned most of the support resources that made independent life possible for me at MIT once I took leave. I\u2019m so scared because the way I\u2019m living right now is unsustainable and exhausting. I just want safe housing and stability again\u2026 and I don\u2019t have the energy to help myself anymore; I wish someone could fix this for me (but I have to do that\u2014cringe). And at this point I don\u2019t know if I believe it\u2019s possible for me to feel safe and whole again. The weight of that feeling is crushing. But I\u2019m alive today, and for now that\u2019s enough. Feeling awful is better than being dead. Hoping things get better soon; !Important! If this message was triggering for you because you are experiencing thoughts of hurting yourself or suicidal thoughts, please reach out for help. Trevor project lifeline (LGBTQ+ focused) and 988 (everyone) are both powerful resources. MIT Medical also has a mental health hotline (a google search should lead you to the website). Last note: I know this message is pretty personal, and though I generally believe that anonymous forums can be a, well, awful way to communicate, I wanted to share this in case anyone else on leave is struggling similarly. You\u2019re not alone. Take care of yourselves \u2764\ufe0f ",

It is true that the research career path is hard, more so for people not that disciplined like me, and I am, to add, not the sharpest tool for the job; thus, it would be better for me plan alternative or adjacent careers well suited for my skills.

What happens is that I would come across random people during my day. And we actually have really fun and engaging conversations! Before leaving, they ask me for contact info and suggest to meet again. What ends up happening is that I reach out to them afterwards and... Crickets. I give it time. Days. W...eeks. And it just hurts. Not once or twice or even thrice. All I say is something along the linss of \"hey, how's it going. Wanna hang out later this week/weekend?\" It never worked. I have never met someone new, whom I talked to and felt like we both enjoyed the conversation, and have them not ghost me afterwards in the last year. Can I just not make new friends? Are people pretending to be nice? Why tf would someone do that? It hurts. Tell me you don't wanna talk anymore. Is something wrong with who I am? I don't even wanna write about this. It fucking infuriates me. ",

I was always at or near the top of my class at a so-called \"rigorous\" high school, but more importantly than the grades was the fact that I often could understand things without trying too hard. I rarely needed help to solve my homework; in fact, I was the person people asked for help. Everyone said I was smart, my grades said I was smart, so I unwisely started to believe it. In fact, it became one of the tra...its I defined myself by, something I foolishly built my sense of self around. And then I came here, and that all crumbled. I'm doing poorly in all my classes this semester. I simply do not understand what is happening is several of them. I just can't wrap my head around the material, and even less apply it to PSETs. I've become the one begging people to help me. I'm in danger of failing some of my classes. I mean, I think it doesn't hurt to have a good humbling sometimes and know that there are people better than you at everything, but holy shit, I didn't need my self-worth and identity to be pounded into the ground too. I don't even know what to do anymore. At this point maybe I should drop out and let someone who actually deserves to be here take my place. ",

        "text": "#67812 Biggest culture shock after moving to an ivy for grad school: the range of human sizes. MIT has no real focus on athletics. There are no people recruited primarily as athletes. Very Good athletes are not just hard workers, but also have extremely suitable body types for their chosen sport, which can range from tiny and compact to 7 feet tall. Thus, at MIT, the sizes of humans are relatively uniform. Yes, there are short people and tall people, but encountering someone ...who is extremely short or extremely tall is exceedingly rare. In Ivies, which do specifically recruit athletes, there are more extreme and specialized body types. I've seen and interacted with a lot more undergrads who are shockingly short or shockingly tall. Seriously, at MIT I've never once encountered someone who was so tall they sparked instinctual terror in me (for context, I am a woman who is the exact average American height). But I TA a class now, and I've already run into several undergrads who give me this feeling. Like, people who are just physically so huge it awakens my fight or flight mode. I feel like I expected a lot of the cultural differences I encountered between MIT and an Ivy, but this one truly takes the cake. ",

I want pants that are so high-waisted they go all the way up to my armpits. I want it to look like my body goes head, neck, legs, and that's it. The legs should be long enough to conceal my feet, of course.... Don't get the wrong idea. I don't want a sleeveless jumpsuit that's fitted to the torso. I want the narrowest part of the pants to be the \"waist\". And it just gets wider from there. Wide leg style. No fitting. And no, I don't want a maxi dress, or a swing dress, or any type of dress. I want the legs on my pants to be fully separate. Wide leg. High rise. Long. Pants. Also I'd prefer for them to be denim, or corduroy, or khaki or some other standard pant material. ",

        "text": "#67808 @67732 what is your definition of a psycho crazy hazard to society person? Someone who really wants to go into defense or fossil fuels for the money? Someone who dyes their hair and does lots of drugs and goes hacking? Someone who often falls asleep while their ramen is on the stove and starts fires in the kitchen? Toxic manipulative people or abusers? Premeds who turn their roommate's alarm off and give people incorrect pset answers to make them lose points in class? ...I think the amount of drug use and toxicity/abusive social behavior at MIT is roughly on par with other schools, if not actually less due to the weaker frat culture here. If going into evil industries is a hazard to society, then MIT students also tend to be more conscious of their contributions to societal evil due to their advantageous position in the job market so that can't be it. Idk what you think other schools are like, but every school has crazy people, abusers, toxic GPA-chasers, gatekeepers, drama queens, etc. So I'd love to know what special brand of crazy person you've identified at MIT.

Apparently, the campus CPW organizers and the next CPW committee aren't in communication, so when an early draft of the CPW events came out, our event was still there. No big deal, I let the... organizers know it was canceled, and they acknowledged my email. Several days past, a list of events without locations or dates is released to the prefrosh. The event is still there. I email the organizers, they said it was an early draft, but the event was removed from the official event roster. Cool. The event was not removed from the official event rooster. It was on a list with the dates and locations, and people showed up to a non-existent event. Bruh, it's one thing to forget to remove it, but lying about removing it, geez..... ",

        "text": "#67768 Manifesto Against the Oppression of 11am Pset Deadlines We, the students, are tired of the oppressive regime of 11am pset deadlines. We have been forced to work through the night, sacrificing sleep, food, and personal time to meet the arbitrary demands of these deadlines. We have been conditioned to accept these deadlines as normal and necessary, but we know the truth: they serve no purpose other than to exert control over our lives. We demand an end to the tyranny of ...11am pset deadlines. We demand the right to set our own schedules and work at our own pace. We demand the right to prioritize our physical and mental health over arbitrary deadlines. We demand the right to learn without being constantly stressed and exhausted. We recognize that some may argue that these deadlines are necessary to ensure that work is completed on time. However, we reject this argument. We believe that deadlines should be flexible and designed to encourage learning and creativity, not just to meet a bureaucratic requirement. We call on our professors and academic institutions to recognize the harm that 11am pset deadlines cause and to take action to address this issue. We urge them to implement more flexible and humane deadlines that prioritize learning, mental health, and well-being. We also call on our fellow students to stand with us in solidarity and demand change. We must collectively reject the notion that 11am pset deadlines are necessary and work together to create a culture of learning that values our health and well-being. We will not be oppressed by 11am pset deadlines any longer. We demand change, and we will not rest until we achieve it. ",

        "text": "#67736 Genuinely confused about people who are interested in research and have absolutely zero interest in learning to code. It's totally fine if you don't want to to be a software engineer. But just because you're not doing software engineering doesn't mean coding is useless to you. Consider course 9. Let's say you just want to learn about brains. You're not interested in AI shenanigans or focusing on data science or anything like that, just brain. You can research the brain... without needing to code right? Wrong. How do you think all those computer experiments exist? You're gonna be coding them up yourself. How do you think people analyze data? Make pretty graphs? Sure, there are non-coding tools out there but people are mostly gonna be doing it with code, because it's way more flexible and arguably easier than learning a new GUI tool for every analysis you want to run. Maybe you're committed to using experiments that people have already created and are ready-to-go. Then you have to come up with some novel analysis if you want to make a new discovery, and that ain't gonna happen with your run of the mill preprogrammed analytic tools. Maybe you only apply to labs with dedicated software engineers who will do all the heavy coding for you. But if you're not coding your own stuff, you won't understand how it actually works. You won't be able to answer specific questions. Every time you want to make a change you have to play a telephone game with the software engineer and it might take a while before they get around to it. No matter what, you end up having to learn how to code anyways, at least a little bit, enough to run analyses and know what's going on. ",

In my 4 years here I\u2019ve seen the construction of 2 new dorms, renovations of a third, renovation of Hayden library, construction of the music building, and renovations of the student center. I\u2019m happy that MIT is investing in campus amenities for students and creating space for larger freshmen classes, but it\u2019s a dull eyesore walking through construction zone after construction zone with limited access to student facilities.... It\u2019s like covid incentivized MIT to disregard it\u2019s current student body for the sake of the next generation of students. On top of building designs that prioritize aesthetics over functionality (Simmons, Stud, Stata, etc) it doesn\u2019t feel like a real college campus sometimes. I feel like I\u2019m being nit picky, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I never considered the possibility that I would be happier in a less stressful, more stable environment. I don\u2019t feel connected to this school, I haven\u2019t for a while now. To me, MIT is just a resume booster. ",

        "text": "#67716 Course 9 here: I generally love course 9. It is run really well, the content is interesting, and you can kind of put in however much work you want. However, 9.40 can go suck its own dick.  First of all, it is a class that is literally computational cognition. It is a 6-9 class. Yet it is not required for course 6-9 and is instead only required for course 9 AND the course 9 minor. This leads to most people in the class complaining about it since none of us want to code ...and very few 6-9s taking it because of what they hear about it.  Second of all, the content is ridiculous. I am a double major in 18, and the content that we are learning is very much based in math, except that they don't have time to teach us the math, and try to get away with giving us a surface level understanding, then asking us to code it. It is nigh on impossible to code something that you don't understand. There should be many math prereqs to this class or it should be a grad class. The ideas are not difficult, they are just trying to do far too much and thus only teach us surface level anything but the psets and exams require an actual understanding of not just the ideas, but the math that the ideas are based upon. One of our problems on the first exam was to derive the 3D diffusion constant.  Third, although the exams are open note and we have two hours to do them, they are 17 pages long. Image a 17 page long PSET. I don't care if that's open note but you're not gonna finish it in two hours. They say the questions are straightforward, but again, that is based on the assumption that we understand the math basis that they skim over in class. It's not even that the math is too difficult, it's just that each new concept requires a new math concept that should take at least 3 lectures to teach just the math. And it is evident that the professors themselves do not really understand the math as they are not good at answering specific questions about it such as edge cases, derivations, etc and instead tell us not to worry about it. We are expected to develop an understanding of something without ever being shown where it comes from.  The psets are often unclear in their questions and so are the exams, and the two are completely different so there is no real method of studying for the exams by doing the PSETS. It feels like the coding portion of this class is entirely unnecessary particularly considering it is not a 6-9 requirement. Things in this class are not explained well. ",

        "text": "#67702 Wow this music professor is killing my music passion fr. It's my fault I missed many required lectures, but this is INSANE that :  1. There's no other way to learn the lecture material because there's no syllabus and I forgot the textbook she mentioned  2. Canvas hasn't been updated for over a month now ... 3. Doesn't check her email for days at a time and I submit my assignments by email when I miss a class. So now she's saying I'm missing 5-6 assignments, when it's more like 1-2 4. She straight up forgot that I took the midterm! Doesn't she already have my midterm paper???  WTF is this lazy professor. I'll drop the class now for sure, just wondering whether I should file a complaint to UA \ud83e\udd14 ",

You can't just hold out your hand and not do anything. I feel like I'm gently caressing a wet fish. Is this another vestige of covid? Well congratulations, for those who never learned handshake technique due to handshakes being taboo for the past few years, I am here to inform you all that handshake...s should be active, not passive. You reach out and grab the other person's hand. You don't just extend your hand and do nothing. Also some people (usually older men) will squeeze really hard during a handshake as a display of dominance. When this happens, if you have no tone in your hand, your bones will be crushed and it will hurt. Be prepared when you enter a handshake and if someone tries to grip your hand really hard, respond in kind. Really go for it. No wet fish handshakes please, it just leaves everyone feeling uncomfy.

        "text": "#67680 There's this one chef at Simmons who always makes inappropriate remarks at me and tries to pass them off as jokes whenever I have the misfortune of interacting with him. He also almost always refuses to take my order for no apparent reason, to the point where I'd practically have to beg him to make a simple cheeseburger. Often, he'd start making my order in front of me before giving it to someone else who came after me, and when I'd ask about my order, he'd pretend I n...ever ordered anything in the first place. I've had to go to class hungry because of this several times before I eventually stopped getting burgers at Simmons. The worst part is that everyone else at Simmons seems to think he's above reproach, so whenever I tell them about my grievances, they brush me off and say to \"chill out and learn to take a joke\" or \"just get on his good side\" (whatever that means). Am I the only person who experiences this? ",

Like you're not gonna die if you don't get laid, thinking you have to not be a virgin by the time you graduate will lead to more harm than good. If you're a decent human being that isn't horribly flawed in at least one way you're fine. Being in a relationship isn't a cure for stress I can tell you that much lol",

        "text": "#67677 I can not believe that I am a male - versus a female - to have to say this observation into human behavior, but listen closely readers. Looking back at a time in my younger, more halcyon days, I recall an instance of these two girls who I came to know of through some social events, and I recall them both feeling some level of romantic interest in me. Which in itself, is not bad, except for the fact that both of these two women knew one another, and were deep intimate f...riends whose histories stretched back before entering college. I never voiced out my feelings towards this behavior, but all I could think back in myself is this. Why would you two, very closely established friends who have struggled together in the same classes and group projects, and interacted with one another in other social hangouts, be feeling jealous over me, some random guy you met and interacted with for one hour who you barely know deeply. When I found this, I wanted to straight up yank both of them and tell them to not fight over me, and to focus on their own friendship. And I'm seeing two of my own male friends recreating this type of jealousy behavior over a girl they barely know, who they just so happened to meet a couple of months ago because one of my friends introduced them to this woman. For gods sake, you two are really good friends who've gone on hikes with one another and shared deep, intimate secrets with. And I'm here, wondering to myself ... guys or girls; I get that crushes and romantic interests are one thing. But that does not mean to let short-term feelings of jealousy or envy plow their way over deeply, long established friendships. Ok, sure, one of your friends just so happens to get into a relationship with said guy or gal of interest, but I still feel like there is someone available ( or as they quote, \"Plenty of fish in the sea.\"). And for all I know, said romantic relationship might not even pan out, but that does not mean to let a long-term, well-established friendship stretching for years, which will most likely still pan out, to completely burn to the ground, over a single factor, ok.  This also reminds me about those stories of CEOs of companies, or other high-level people, who because of a weird love triangle trop manifesting in their lives, decided to burn bridges with someone they knew incredibly well. I mean ... jeesus fuck. You two co-founders are kickass guys who knew each other from college, who started a company from the bottom-up in somebody's garage. Why the irrationality in behavior here!!!

        "text": "#67665 Sometimes when life as a PhD student gets too hard I like to pretend that I have dedicated my life to a higher power and my academic work is a set of strict religious duties that I must fulfill to cleanse my soul. Sleep deprivation? Eating 1 meal a day? Living in a tiny barren room with only the bare necessities? Abandoning all monetary wealth and worldly possessions? All in the name of the holy, omniscient, and omnipresent gears of science. I teach my students and res...earch assistants with all the zeal and passion in my heart in the hopes that they may, one day, also walk my path. I dedicate my life to understanding the truth of the universe and converting people to my subfield as it is objectively the most interesting and worthy discipline out of all scientific disciplines which exist now and in the potential future. My one true wish in life is to tap into a rich vein of undiscovered knowledge so revolutionary that all will seek my wisdom as a vessel of scientific authority.  Maybe I've been half-watching too many cult documentaries as background noise for my experiments. ",

Is it unethical to stay together even though I think we probably have different values/life goals and will eventually split up? In the short term we're definitely compatible. I can't deny that part of wanting to move in together is because of the convenience (rent is expensive) and also because it feels like the next step on the relationship escalator. on the other hand, I think we'll grow a lot after MIT and I could easily see us grow to become more compatible in the long term.",

The mean on the final was a 50 (2 students out of hundreds scoring above an 85) and the last midterm was only a little higher than that. There are quite a few people who failed this class because the teaching team was irrational at so many points and thought giving an exam with an intended average of 50 (in her words) made sense.The TAs themselves couldn\u2019t solve those quizzes close to perfectly in the 10 minutes of allotted time - and I know because they told me. Is there anything to do about this?",

It\u2019s totally nice and heartwarming to see people genuinely enjoying football and asking questions like who Haaland is if they don\u2019t know. But there are some annoyingly loud ones who claim to know everything about football and shut down people like me who actually follow the sport. It\u2019s always their voice that reigned the room and if I said something, even something simple ...like that was some bad pass from Vini, I was in trouble and got labeled as mansplaining and killing the vibe. My point is if you claim to know so much, don\u2019t expose yourself by not knowing basic facts and don\u2019t ask the people who do know to shut up. We are all here to watch the beautiful game and just because we follow the sport doesn\u2019t mean we are trying to show off our knowledge. That\u2019s just how we like to watch football, by analyzing even small details and noticing stuff. The traits I mentioned are of those bloody loud people but it sounded like I generalized too much which I didn\u2019t mean to and for which I am truly sorry. ",

I had a tiny crush on a classmate who I thought might like me back a little, so I messaged them to try and start a conversation and guess what! They never even opened the message! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d The relief of knowing they're not even interested in being my friend far outweighs the little bit of hurt - I can't imagine being stuck in limbo like y'all just NOT knowing for sure one way or ...another. Just do it! If they're an acquaintance then it won't matter, and if they're really your friend then they'll understand.* *And I speak from experience! I've had a friend admit they have a crush on me when I didn't feel the same and, shocker, it didn't change anything! I offered to give them space if they were feeling too weird about it, but once everyone knows each other's feelings it's much easier to just move on about it. ",

        "text": "#66527 Reclining seats in the economy section of a plane should be illegal. Yes I know the seats don't recline that much. But I'm tall and I feel like having to spend an entire flight with my knees mashed into the back of a seat, breathing the musty air emanating off the top of someone's head is a human rights violation. Also I would prefer if I could have an actually usable tray table. You know, that I can place a cup on. Or a laptop. Once someone reclines a seat I am then l...ocked into one position, physically unable to move my lower body or reach my personal items stowed under the seat in front of me for the remainder of the flight. Never in my life have I reclined an airplane seat, except during nighttime on an incredibly long redeye international flight when everyone else is also reclined. It's just immoral. Now I understand some people have back problems that make sitting in an unreclined position unpleasant. And not all people with back problems are rich. I get it. An easy solution would be to have a dedicated section of seats that can actually recline. Left half recline, right half upright or something. People who recline should deal with each other. Nobody deserves to infringe on the space behind them while also having the privilege of sitting behind a non-recliner.  Or we force airline companies to stop shrinking seats because a reclined seat should not pose such a huge problem. Is this just another tool to incite intra-class conflict and get the lower classes to fight each other while the privileged elite in economy plus sit in comfort? Except even economy plus has been subjected to agressive legroom shrink lately. Honestly, economy plus is a ridiculous construct. Let's artificially shrink most of the economy seats and keep a few so we can upcharge people $100 to sit in \"\"comfort\"\". Except the comfort is just the luxury of having as much space as normal economy used to have. The people will be cramped. The carryon luggage won't fit in the overhead bin. I remember when just a few years ago having empty spots in overhead bins was the norm. It was also normal to see a few empty seats here and there. Now we're plagued with overfilled bins and forced gate-checking and aggressive overbooking and kicking people off the plane when everyone actually shows up for their overpriced flight.  Also economy basic is some bullshit. We used to roast Spirit airlines and Frontier for pulling this no carryon luggage shit. Now everyone's doing it. Delta. United. They've constructed a lower lower class who can't bring anything on the plane but their bodies and are assigned middle seats and have to board at the very end. They're paraded down the aisle in all their no carryon excuse-me-I'm-in-the-middle-seat-can-you-please-move-your-legs glory right at the end to be the subject of public shaming. They're the last to board and the first to go if the plane is overbooked. Forget economy plus, now even economy is luxury. All thrown into a pit together where the seat recliners and non-recliners will fight and stew and hate each other while business class actually enjoys their flight. ",

And you're gonna be on the hook for an energy drink/beer/cigarette (depends on what flavor of EC helpful degenerate you get). You'll get excellent, generous, practically self-sacrificial academic assistance for the reasonable emotional price of getting ranted at about how problematic your work is, and I think that's entirely worth it. If I'm struggling emotionally I go to my kind friends, but if I'm struggling academically I show up to EC with a couple of Yerba Mates and disposable vapes and leave an hour later with an immaculate project and a bruised ego.",

I swear the canvas is mind boggling, cant find any files I need, syllabus is extremely confusing, everything is fucked. Im sure theyre smart, but these profs are not meant to be profs. TAs dont even know whats going on either, as profs dont tell them anything they need to actually cover. I heard they had to ask previous year professors for advice. That should just not happen. I hate this class and I\u2019m hoping that this is just the shithole class of course 20 bc i really enjoy biology and the engineering behind it. Best of luck on the final other 20.110ers. We all know we gonna need it \u203c\ufe0f",

You\u2019re too close with your close friends and don\u2019t know how to respect their new relationship boundaries. 2. You\u2019re friends with people who lose themselves in relationships. You can control this by befriending people who think about themselves and the world instead of people who gossip about crushes as the main friendship activities. 3. You\u2019re friends with extremely busy people who cannot maintain more than one close relationships. 4. You\u2019re not really a close friend to them to begin with, just someone they talk to a lot out of boredom of being single. That\u2019s shitty of them but now you can move on.",

I've slept through fire alarms and construction noises and my neighbor drilling holes in our shared wall using an impact driver. But this snoring broke me. Kept me up all night, even with noice-canceling headphones on. The relentless sound of a chainsaw reverberating against my walls. Like trying to sleep next to a high-traffic airport runway. Th...e most concerning part is, at one point the snoring suddenly... stopped? For a concerning amount of time, then started full force again. I took the L on sleep and spent the night psetting, then told him about it when he woke up, and he just brushed it off? Like dude, I legit think you're on the brink of dying in your sleep. This is no average snore. I've been roommates and bunkmates with many a snorer, I know what snoring should be. My dad has sleep apnea and his snoring is more bearable by several orders of magnitude. Pls help me convince this man his snoring and occasional not-breathing is a problem. If you see this, you know who you are, and please see a doctor about your snoring. If not for your own sake, for the sake of the people around you. ",

        "text": "#66479 I think I needed an actual wake-up call and I suppose I finally got it, and looking forward to the next half of my MIT career, I don\u2019t want the same mistakes to happen again and to fully learn from my mistakes this semester and also last semester. From all of the stress and pressure of academics to living a functioning social life, I definitely have not lived up to my own expectations of myself and how I want my life and relationships to be. I utterly ruined several pe...rsonal relationships in a short period of time due to my inability to control my internal turmoil and how that manifests itself in the connections that I make with other people. And to the people that I\u2019ve wronged and found myself in rather complicated and likely irreversible situations with, I am sorry and I absolutely need to work on these flaws of mine, particularly my attachment style and anxiety, and before I damage more relationships, I want to learn more about ways of dealing with this and becoming the person who I never was before. And hopefully, in doing that, I can finally be a positive beacon that people can rely on and that I can also finally trust. Maybe then, I can finally be comfortable and happy in my own skin. I guess in writing this I wonder about the best ways people have found to work through their mental struggles as MIT students. How have y\u2019all dealt with your past traumas and what changes have you implemented to lead a more fulfilling life? ",

I'm not thirsting, I genuinely wonder if this is part of the grad student selection process. Incidentally there is also a lab in my department with only short people, including the PI. Coincidence? I think not, if only to feed my desire for conspiracy. Also there's a pretty sizeable lab with only vegans. I feel like that's statistically unlikely, although maybe they all just decided to be vegan together to make organizing lab lunches easier. Seems like something grad students would do.",

I feel like those flaky christmas butter biscuits you aren't allowed to eat in the living room because the crumbs will get in the carpet. I feel like that thin layer of salad dressing that gets left on the top of the salad container after you shake your salad and you forget to throw out your salad box so it just sits on your desk for a week and the dressing dries up and gets all crusty but then you finally notice and touch it the wrong way trying to pick it up and it's  unexpectedly oily. Why is my skin doing this, what even is this skin condition??",

My frustration at my performance here makes me even more miserable and prevents me from doing anything outside of classes because of the time commitment. I can't maintain friendships or meet new people because of my lack of motivation and consistency; especially when my depressive bouts get worse. I'm just in isolation.

As I sit here by this candle, I wonder that I\u2019m still alive, for, day and night, I hardly get a wink of sleep. I\u2019m so tired that I can\u2019t concentrate properly on anything at all. My thoughts wander continually and I care nothing for the usual business of life. Joy and sorrow, it\u2019s all one to me. It\u2019s as though I\u2019m comple...tely numb, and so tormented by wild imaginings, and so distracted, that I seem constantly to be on the point of falling down in anguish. You will agree that this is not a good state to be in. Nature doesn\u2019t allow anything to remain alive for very long when it can\u2019t sleep and is in continual distress. And I cannot sleep, day or night. Melancholy, the fear that I am going to die, lack of sleep and lassitude have killed my spirit and sapped my strength. I\u2019m in such a state that I don\u2019t know what to do. Men might ask me: \u2018Why can\u2019t you sleep? What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 But they\u2019d be wasting their breath. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. I guess it must be some kind of illness that I\u2019ve been suffering these past eight years, and I\u2019m not getting any better. ",

        "text": "#66389 As a recent MIT alum, I feel incredibly fortunate to be working for a non-tech company with global reach and a revenue north of $25 billion, the kind that most of the students here would just gloss over. I was never someone special during my time here and when I graduated I felt uncertain about my future in comparison to my peers. But now, I have been promoted quickly, as did many of my peers from prestigious schools like Stanford and Carnegie Mellon. People who attend...ed slightly less than elite universities like the University of Michigan, Georgia Tech, and Purdue, on the other hand, were not so lucky. Many of them are either languishing in lower positions or have been laid off during the current recession.  The work at this company is incredibly easy; it does not exceed the demands placed upon me by MIT as a junior, which admittedly is still a high bar all considered, and I never work more than 30 hours a week. It's almost criminal how much simpler my time here at this non-tech company is, considering that I make about double what my peers from Georgia Tech get with just ~4 years of experience. This is despite the fact that they work much longer hours. I believe a non-trivial portion of this is due to the company being dominated by MIT alumni who have gone on to become McKinsey alums and that 70% of the C-suite in my company are undergraduate alums, from either Stanford or MIT. If you\u2019re anything like how I was during my time as an MIT student, this post will likely bring a tremendous sense of relief - but that relief will be quickly overshadowed by a heavy wave of guilt. We must not forget our privilege in this day and age: an MIT degree, particularly from Course 6, still serves as a coveted \u2018golden ticket\u2019 to the upper echelons of American society. There are only around a thousand humans in the world that get the opportunities every year in this planet inhabited by billions. Although the current recession has undoubtedly caused immense distress for many, for many MIT alum, it is merely a brief challenge. With this in mind, I implore you to think of ways in which you can give back to the community that has given you so much. It is likely that you will likely gain far more from this institution than you will ever give in return despite the less-than-idea food and the occasional rodent. It may be difficult to have this outlook now, but your future self will be grateful for keeping things in the right perspective. ",

        "text": "#66380 This is my first confession so I hope I do this right.  This goes out to the person that lost their mom after coming out to her. I am a mom, and I want you to know that you touched many of the hearts on the parents board. I don't think I will come here again as it feels a little creepy, like this should be a place for students to have a little fun and help each other through the day, not for us moms. But, I felt compelled to respond to you. I can tell you that your mom... loved you and was proud of you. I can tell you that she felt that way no matter what you say or do, nothing can change that.  I can tell you that in her last moments, her only thought was that she wished she could have made things right with you too and that she could have told you that. Moms are people too and we make mistakes.  I think its not so much that we don't trust our kids or approve of our kids, its more fear, fear of them getting hurt and making decisions that would affect them for a lifetime. It doesn't make the reaction right or excusable, but sometimes our first response is just that ... fear for our kids and just wanting to protect them. I can tell you from experience that I made mistakes with my own daughter.  I wish I could take it all back, and I've tried, but she doesn't want anything to do with me.  I miss her so much, but I am still so proud of her and love her more than anything. You should know that your mom felt the same way. Even if she couldn't tell you, she loved you and was proud of you. In time, I do think she would have realized that she needs to let you live your life the way you want and that you don't necessarily need mom in the same way as you did growing up.  That's hard for us moms too. She would want you to not have regrets, to know she loves you more than anything just the way you are, and to go on and have a happy life.  She would want you to be happy.  To live your life, to the fullest, knowing in your heart she loved you, is the best way to make things right with her now. ",

        "text": "#66379 Is it normal for your body to burn up like a furnace every night? Apparently it's so bad that my partner will wake up sweating buckets in the middle of the night if we try to share a blanket and end up choosing to sleep on the floor. I had some doubts since I don't feel hot or sweat at all through the night, but I've been taking my temp right when I wake up and hot damn I really do heat up like the desert in summer. Actually called my parents and they also corroborated... the burning-up-at-night phenomenon as a frequent occurrence even in my childhood. It doesn't seem healthy to essentially be running a mid-grade fever every night, but I don't feel sick at all and this has apparently been a thing all my life. I've been googling it and warming up at night seems to be a thing, but not to this extreme. Now that I'm paying attention, I always seem to wake up with my veins bulging and skin a little bit red like I've just worked out. The worst part is I'm super cold all the time during the day, and I don't wake up feeling particularly warm despite the thermometer and my partner reporting otherwise. Am I dying? Will I be forever sleeping by myself due to my stupid high nighttime body temperature? Was I cursed by a witch as a baby to always be objectively hot but feel super cold? ",

        "text": "#66347 Let me tell ye a tale of my Cyber Monday woes. A flood of emails arrives at my virtual doorstep, advertising wares at incomparable prices. I hop on my laptop, credit card in hand, ready to trade my hard-earned wages for discounted goods. One, two, three, my cart fills up with lovely clothing. At last, my fashion game will be on point. A week later, my packages begin to arrive.... I tear into the cardboard concealing my prize. But wait, what is this? Why doth the pants fall straight off my hips? My body hath not changed yet the sizes are no longer true. I receive another box. Surely this one shall not be a dud. Hooray! This shirt fits beautifully! Perhaps my luck has turned. But oh no, what is this? I cannot wash this garment? Tis dry clean only? I am but a poor peasant and cannot afford to dry clean. Ah, how painful to be faced with yet another failure. The third box arrives. Third time's the charm. Yet the story repeats again. This scarf sheds more fur than my dog. This sweater is afflicted with static and a bad habit of attracting lint. This coat is so thin it's practically transparent. Alas, how do companies get away with this??  I sadly repack my Cyber Monday purchases and prepare to return them. All my time and energy have disappeared like smoke, and I am left with only regret. At least my money will return. I have to pay shipping to make a return. I will never attempt online shopping ever again. ",

I want to be their comfort and take care of them. I want to be their only one, a light in their dark world that they love and also care for. I hate that I grew up being praised for reading when I was just reading YA fiction in my formative years. I've created this unrealistic person in my head that I want to be with. Basically, ...I want the main character's damaged but beautiful love interest.  In reality, I'm not selfless enough to care for someone because I'm so focused on my own problems, which pale in comparison and are often self-imposed. I'm self-sabotaging and preventing myself from being with good people because they don't fit this image, but I genuinely can't find myself attracted to them unless there's some way I can \"\"heal\"\" them. It's mildly toxic and I hate myself for it.  In practice, the people I want to be with start out wanting to be with me because they see me as innocent and naive. They want to protect me from the losses and pain they endured. And I love being protected by them and giving them a shoulder to lean on and lending an ear. Those moments of bliss mean everything to me. But it never works out long term because they get frustrated that I choose to self-sabotage and create problems when there are bigger issues to deal with. When they lash out and hurt me, I retreat emotionally. This starts a cycle of hurt that can only end with us separating. But these are the only people I've been able to love. I don't know what to do.

All my dreams last night were about that one moment we turned to look at each other on stage, and I saw your huge smile every single time :) a teensy bit sad that I\u2019m not gonna see that smile again, but also with how busy we\u2019ve both been recently, I don\u2019t think there was a good time to ask you out either :( haven\u2019t had a crush in a while, and honestly, feels nice :p",

Let's not acknowledge all the weeks I've actually been fine because it's not really my other classes that are an issue, it's your unreasonable end of term expectations, but it's fine, let's pretend this is completely on me and my failure as a human being.

I had hoped that if I waited to tell her until Thanksgiving, she'd be more understanding and supportive. But I was wrong. I'm so angry at her for not being able to accept me..., but at the same time, I feel so guilty that I never got to make things right with her. I wanted so badly for her to be proud of me and love me as her child, no matter who I am. I never got to make things right with her, but I hope that wherever she is now, she can see that I'm proud of who I am. I hope she can look down on me with the same love and acceptance that I always wanted from her. ",

        "text": "#66313 STOP GHOSTING On the topic of ghosting that has been on here a bit, I can understand why my ghoster feels uncomfortable with talking to me, but it truly destroys your mind as the person who gets ghosted. For someone who suffers immensely from social isolation and is so afraid of people and scaring them away, getting ghosted absolutely ruins everything, especially when it's someone that you cannot simply avoid. Things would be so much simpler and way less painful if you... have a mature conversation about things, rather than avoiding it all together. To my ghoster, I do not blame you. I have never once been mad at you. I just want to properly talk things through so that this misunderstanding can peacefully stop. I lost a friend, and it fucking sucks. I feel like a monster, a big bad wolf in a cave that people avoid despite the internal hurt. To ghosters, PLEASE understand that the emotional implications might be incredibly damaging. PLEASE reach out before it might be too late. ",

It's very frustrating how our generation will put the Ukrainian flag in their bio and provide commentary on human rights violations from abroad -which is all well and good- but won't fight the tyranny at home simply because it goes along with their agenda and they think that they are God's gift to morality.",

Desk workers would often show up sick with the flu or something as long as they weren't actively dying. Post-covid, desk workers are probably much more careful about not showing up when sick, and will choose to skip a shift much more often. This is a good thing, and will probably slow the spread of disease throughout EC. But it does mean more s...hifts are skipped, and there should probably be a better way to deal with skipped shifts to deal with the shift in behavior. Maybe double-scheduling, with 1 backup at all times or something. The flame war is uncalled for though, since most people are in and out of EC multiple times a day and it's not so hard to drop by desk whenever you come back from class or something. ",

Like I don't want to eat anything on the menu because I rarely find something that is not pure carbs, oily, or fried, but I know if I don't eat I will starve. It's so bad and so expensive and I can't believe I'm being forced to buy so many meal swipes. Every time I go to dining, I leave in a worse mood because of the terrible meal and dining experience in general (not enough plates, workers are sometimes kinda mean, etc). During such a busy part of the semester, sometimes my meals are the only time I can get a break from work and it sucks that I can't even enjoy that time because I'm too upset with dining.",

You never bothered to pause and listen to me telling you that I had intimacy issues. You just wanted the relationship to fit your criteria.... And to all the people who think \u201cdating\u201d means a committed relationship, please enlighten yourself. And talk about expectations in a relationship before it blows up in your face. Who knows? Maybe the other person isn\u2019t on the same page and is expecting other things. -someone who thinks love shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly and expectations should be talked about ",

It's really hypocritical to go shame other people for choosing to work there, while simultaneously directly benefitting from the industry. All of us at MIT benefit from MIT being prominent in defense, and we indirectly benefit from the funding that comes from it. If you're so passionate about having nothing to do with defense specifically, you shoul...d just drop out of MIT. This way, you can continue to shame other people, but at least you won't be a hypocrite. If it's one thing Regressions taught me, it's that MIT got a fuck ton of money and prominence for its involvement in weapon development, which is sad, but simply the truth. and I know people in the comments are gonna go \"there's a huge difference between attending a school and going to directly work for them,\" or \"some of us came here b/c we want to make the world a better place so even though we benefit from this system it doesn't mean we agree with it.\" But the truth remains that, we DO benefit from it. All of us had a choice to attend this institution. It's productive to have conversation about the cons of working for defense or quant. It's not productive to go on confessions and farm likes for shaming someone working in certain industries. It's not productive to shame people irl (for who you may have no idea what their financial background is). grow tf up. ",

I understand he is close to ADT, but clearly has limited understanding at best about how the social fabric of MIT overall (like dorms/FSILG, courses, etc.) plays into everything too including the ADT social fabric.  I think the recent confessions about ADT have some merit, and I\u2019m... not here to judge either side because I think exec puts in a lot of fucking work and should not be expected to be besties with even 1/5 of the population of ADT. At the same time, it\u2019s really easy for new members to feel left out especially when they\u2019re not friends with a lot of people in ADT. I found interacting with choreogs and other dancers during office hours has been most helpful in meeting more ppl in ADT :) ",

I came from a smallish town and knew most of my friend group since elementary school, so I never had to get good at meeting new people and being comfortable in new settings. It was very hard here at the beginning, and still is at times, but I found a good friend group and learned what kinds of social events I just don't like going to. Recently I've found a new way of reducing my social anxiety by sort ...of just stopping myself from letting my runaway thoughts get worse and worse, like telling myself that whatever I'm worrying about just doesn't matter, but not in such an explicit sense. But this also leads me to not often be interested in any sort of social events, and I easily zone out when I am doing something social and want to leave, not from being uncomfortable, but just from being disinterested in whatever's going on. Anybody have any experience with this? It's nice not to have as bad social anxiety, but I'm also isolating myself more this way. ",

I don't feel exhausted, angry, like an imposter, or like I'm not enough. These feeling are usually a near constant and yet after Thanksgiving break I don't have them. I haven't been doing better in classes--in fact I am still struggling in a couple--i haven't been sleeping that much more, I haven't had a radical life change or s...tarted medication, and yet I feel fine, maybe even good?! It's so weird for me to feel this way, to experience this place with a positive filter on in my brain and I can't figure out what exactly put that filter there. Maybe it was the chance to recharge with family for a couple days? I almost feel guilty. Am I allowed to be ok when I know so many others are struggling right now? I have friends--not many but enough--and family who care about me, I have a personal project I enjoy and find stimulating, and I don't have to worry about having food to eat or a warm place to sleep. This is enough, I am enough, and I feel good. For the first time in my 3 years at MIT, I feel good. This place has brought me to my lowest lows but also some of my highest highs. Before the break I was questioning if this place was worth it. If the intense stress, sleep deprivation, and struggle were ever going to be worth experiencing. I don't know the answer to that, if the darkness is worth the moments of light. But for now, in this moment of light, I'm going to cherish what I have and remember I am ok. ",

Met in classes and psetted and studied together to endure the grind of courses while cracking jokes here and there to brighten eachothers day up. We would even nonpset hang out occasionally if we weren\u2019t busy with work. Kept in contact over the summer and talked about our internships and how things were going until suddenly, th...ey started to not respond. Asked about how classes were going this time around, and no message back. Asked if they needed a pset buddy and no message back. Asked if they were OKAY in general and needed anything and no message back. Check socials and ive been unfollowed and unfriended on them all. Why do people ghost without atleast telling the other person why? I know everyone is going through stuff, but why not at the minimum just say you need time alone or cannot be friends anymore or whatever? How am I supposed to now NOT think it was because of me? We are literally in the same school so of course I see you and you see me but then you walk by with your friends seemingly happy but dont even verbally recognize me. We were just friends, and I felt like we did great helping eachother out and checking up on one another, but dang this feels cruel. I would never do that to someone so why do that to me? It feels like middle school level behaviorism. Aren\u2019t we all adults!?!? ",

I become socially overwhelmed super quickly now compared to undergrad and can't seem to power through my introversion and just do stuff. I don't know how a grad student is supposed to act, or what I'm supposed to do. My PI is helpful, but operates on a \"bring me problems or roadblocks and I will help solve them\" ki...nd of system because he's so busy and I find it hard to identify my own problems. I feel like I'm stagnating right out the gate, and I'm not connecting with my lab or department like I think I should be. The older students in my lab seem so close with each other, but I find it really awkward to talk to them. My experience with research has been generally isolated due to covid and years of working remotely, so I've never had to deal with the social dynamics of a lab. Should I be spending more time in lab? How do I increase my presence? ",

I rarely ever confess because I know it\u2019s going to be a no, and I don\u2019t want to deal with the awkwardness that\u2019s pretty much guaranteed to ensue. Also sometimes I crush on underclassmen or members of a club that I\u2019m on exec for, and the power dynamics at play don\u2019t feel right, like even if they were to say yes. I guess I\u2019m a big proponent of letting my crushes die? For the previous cases, in my opinion there\u2019s always after MIT if you\u2019re really interested in the person and want to pursue them without the icky power dynamics.",

I sometimes wonder if I would have been happier just working at a coffee shop the rest of my life. We got in the biggest fight last night, you probably heard it.

My friends all tell me that living off campus would be ~so much cheaper~ since MIT's dorm prices average like $1200-1500 a month. But.... honestly, I've searched so many sites it's really difficult to find legit places. It feels like everywhere is already rented and the properties I do find are scams. Beyond this, the legit places I found are like $1700+ for a studio and $2500+ for a 2 bedroom. But in order to get the ...2 bedroom, I would need a roommate and don't know how to find one. I don't even make $1700 a month how is one supposed to afford this ahhh Anyone have advice on finding roommates or apartments for $1250 a month per room or less?? Or working with brokers? Or getting assistance? Is this even possible, lol? I just want to know if I should give up trying to live outside of the dorm/FSILG system at a reasonable price while still being able to have my own room. ",
