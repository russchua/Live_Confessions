  "postTitle": "#68130 I've started writing this confession several times and stopped myself, because I know there's no real point to it, but I guess I just want to say these things in whatever way I can.\n\nI actually fell in love, I think for the very first time. Admittedly it's not real love, like when you totally surrender to the vulnerability of it because it's reciprocal, and might just be everything it could ever be. It's pretty obvious she's not interested in me. I know I'm lucky just because I can even be so delusional as to think that she might be interested - that I might be in her league. However close I might be to her feeling the same way about me, just the fact that I can have these daydreams and think they could come true is already a nice thing - I remember growing up and thinking I wouldn't be good enough for anyone at all, so things really could be a whole lot worse. But I've had her on my mind for such a long time, because this girl is so beautiful in every way, and I don't remember feeling quite like this about anyone for the longest time. I've thought of a million compliments for her, and my heart actually aches sometimes when I think about her. She has such a pretty laugh, and she's so graceful, so feminine, and so driven too, a really strong person and yet totally disarming in how beautiful she is. I mean, she's gorgeous, but it's her personality that makes her totally radiant. I'm amazed by how hard it is for me to accept reality when I want something this much. Mostly I'm happy to have this aching feeling though, to know what it's like to really feel so much tenderness for someone. It puts things into perspective, and gives me a little glimpse of the beautiful emotions that I could someday get lost in."

But you looked at me like I’m a womanizing predator, and it hurts me that you think I’m capable of such despicable things such as emotional manipulation. If you just fucking talked to me about it instead of sweeping it under the rug until it was convenient for you, I would have took it to heart and maybe done something about it.

  "postTitle": "#68058 Are you someone whose friends always seem to exclude you from things?\n\nHave you ever thought about why they don't invite you? People don't do things without a reason. There are really only two scenarios, with two clear courses of action to take.\n\nThe first scenario is that this friend group is toxic and mean-spirited and exclude people from things for selfish/immature reasons that would persist regardless of your character. You should not be sad that they excluded you. In fact, you should be thanking your lucky stars that you dodged an entire hailstorm of bullets, and go and find some better friends.\n\nThe second scenario is that there is nothing obviously wrong with the friend group. They are relatively decent people, and they get along with each other fine and hang out all the time, just not with you. Have you really, deeply thought about why this might be? Think about it - why would an entire friend group exclude someone who is kind and fun to be around? Would *you* want to avoid someone who was kind and fun to be around? People do not do things (or consistently \"forget\" to invite someone) for no reason - there's ALWAYS a reason. Thus the only possibility is that you are unkind or unpleasant to be around, or both (usually there is a strong correlation between these traits). In this case, you should not find it unreasonable that your so-called friends don't include you in things (since you'd probably do the same thing to someone you didn't like, wouldn't you?). Instead, if your friend group is a group that you care about and want to keep your connections with, you should try to become a kinder and more pleasant person that people would naturally want to hang out with - you can't really force anyone to want to be with you. It may take some time for them to notice, so you will need to be patient - of course, there is also no guarantee that they'll ever notice, but it's not like you've lost anything by becoming a kinder person. The other possibility (and by far the easiest thing for you to do) is that you don't change at all - in this case, you should be prepared to continue being excluded from things, and you should no longer be upset about it - after all, it's your choice.\n\nTl;dr - if none of your friends want to hang out with you, either your friends all have problems, or you have problems. If your friends all have problems, then find better friends. If you have problems, then be a better person.\n\nSome notes: I've noticed that for a great deal of people (especially for people who post complaints on this page), whenever something doesn't go their way, they immediately think that it's everyone's problem but their own. This is a mindset that doesn't promote introspection or self-improvement, displays a lack of wisdom, and leads to things like MIT Confessions posts about problems that have very obvious (though not necessarily easy) solutions, if one took only a few minutes to think about it first."

Especially in the world of politics, there’s a weird obsession with winning and doubling down at any cost that just makes the world a more unpleasant place.\n\nEven if this post isn’t directed at you, try setting aside pride next time you catch yourself slipping and apologize to someone instead of escalating the situation.

Let’s not forget that as Israel “gained independence” they displaced 700,000 Palestinians from their homes. From close to the beginning defining a state of Israel was synonymous with homogenizing the region.  To this day Israel continues to build settlements in the occupied West Bank, which is illegal under the Geneva convention, but we all know that the US and other countries only give a shit if they have something strategic to gain from intervening. \n\nTake two seconds from your day to think about how a celebration like this impacts Palestinian students at MIT. Cancel this event and don’t plan a celebration for a day with such a painful, awful history."

I have SO MUCH respect for these artists that continue to hone their craft while hosed. I am so lucky to exist at the same time and place as fixation show because every single piece was a masterpiece and so creative and so beautifully executed T_T I love fixation so much"

Somehow for the first time in a long time I feel at peace and content at the pace I’m going in life :)) Sure, maybe I’m not going to publish a paper or whatever, and I might not end my semester with a good GPA, but I don’t regret spending 3 hours reading outside in the spring weather while the shadows of the tree shade glides across my page as the day goes on, and I don’t regret prioritizing my health and getting 7 days of sleep per week. Will I regret it later? Probably, but for the first time in my life in the past 10 years it feels like nothing is missing in my life, and I don’t need to be rushing towards some sort of a validation, and I finally have time to take a break, breathe, and orient myself"

Someone who dyes their hair and does lots of drugs and goes hacking? Someone who often falls asleep while their ramen is on the stove and starts fires in the kitchen? Toxic manipulative people or abusers? Premeds who turn their roommate's alarm off and give people incorrect pset answers to make them lose points in class? I think the amount of drug use and toxicity/abusive social behavior at MIT is roughly on par with other schools, if not actually less due to the weaker frat culture here. If going into evil industries is a hazard to society, then MIT students also tend to be more conscious of their contributions to societal evil due to their advantageous position in the job market so that can't be it. Idk what you think other schools are like, but every school has crazy people, abusers, toxic GPA-chasers, gatekeepers, drama queens, etc. So I'd love to know what special brand of crazy person you've identified at MIT."

Miss me with that mid-rise bullshit. 11\" rise is the absolute bare minimum for a high-waisted pant. Even better if it's 12\", or even 13\". Fuck it. I want pants that go all the way up. I want pants that are so high-waisted they go all the way up to my armpits. I want it to look like my body goes head, neck, legs, and that's it. The legs should be long enough to conceal my feet, of course. Don't get the wrong idea. I don't want a sleeveless jumpsuit that's fitted to the torso. I want the narrowest part of the pants to be the \"waist\". And it just gets wider from there. Wide leg style. No fitting. And no, I don't want a maxi dress, or a swing dress, or any type of dress. I want the legs on my pants to be fully separate. Wide leg. High rise. Long. Pants.\n\nAlso I'd prefer for them to be denim, or corduroy, or khaki or some other standard pant material."

For some, this is the first time they’ve had access to a proper gym, or maybe just the first time they’ve decided to exercise in a gym, and that’s perfectly fine. Everyone is at a different ability and comfort level, so unless someone is in danger of hurting themselves, STFO and let people exercise the way they want to.

I am humbled and grateful to MIT for the scholarship and the fact that they are needs blind - because of MIT I am able to break the cycle of generational poverty. My dad worked at a very labor intensive job only to make minimum wage to support me and my siblings. He passed unexpectedly in a car accident last year and I never got the chance to thank him.  My mom was my biggest supporter. She never missed a soccer game or math competition.  She saw my potential and pushed me when I needed it and was the first to tell me if I was getting off track, even if I didn't like it at the time. She never spent a dime on herself, everything was for me and my siblings. I have no doubt that I wouldn't be here without my parents and I tell my mom that every time I see her and I plan to make sure she is taken care of."

You can't just hold out your hand and not do anything. I feel like I'm gently caressing a wet fish. Is this another vestige of covid? Well congratulations, for those who never learned handshake technique due to handshakes being taboo for the past few years, I am here to inform you all that handshakes should be active, not passive. You reach out and grab the other person's hand. You don't just extend your hand and do nothing. Also some people (usually older men) will squeeze really hard during a handshake as a display of dominance. When this happens, if you have no tone in your hand, your bones will be crushed and it will hurt. Be prepared when you enter a handshake and if someone tries to grip your hand really hard, respond in kind. Really go for it. No wet fish handshakes please, it just leaves everyone feeling uncomfy."

Apparently it's so bad that my partner will wake up sweating buckets in the middle of the night if we try to share a blanket and end up choosing to sleep on the floor. I had some doubts since I don't feel hot or sweat at all through the night, but I've been taking my temp right when I wake up and hot damn I really do heat up like the desert in summer. Actually called my parents and they also corroborated the burning-up-at-night phenomenon as a frequent occurrence even in my childhood. It doesn't seem healthy to essentially be running a mid-grade fever every night, but I don't feel sick at all and this has apparently been a thing all my life. I've been googling it and warming up at night seems to be a thing, but not to this extreme. Now that I'm paying attention, I always seem to wake up with my veins bulging and skin a little bit red like I've just worked out. The worst part is I'm super cold all the time during the day, and I don't wake up feeling particularly warm despite the thermometer and my partner reporting otherwise. Am I dying? Will I be forever sleeping by myself due to my stupid high nighttime body temperature? Was I cursed by a witch as a baby to always be objectively hot but feel super cold?"

For someone who suffers immensely from social isolation and is so afraid of people and scaring them away, getting ghosted absolutely ruins everything, especially when it's someone that you cannot simply avoid. Things would be so much simpler and way less painful if you have a mature conversation about things, rather than avoiding it all together. To my ghoster, I do not blame you. I have never once been mad at you. I just want to properly talk things through so that this misunderstanding can peacefully stop. I lost a friend, and it fucking sucks. I feel like a monster, a big bad wolf in a cave that people avoid despite the internal hurt. To ghosters, PLEASE understand that the emotional implications might be incredibly damaging. PLEASE reach out before it might be too late."

Met in classes and psetted and studied together to endure the grind of courses while cracking jokes here and there to brighten eachothers day up. We would even nonpset hang out occasionally if we weren’t busy with work. Kept in contact over the summer and talked about our internships and how things were going until suddenly, they started to not respond. Asked about how classes were going this time around, and no message back. Asked if they needed a pset buddy and no message back. Asked if they were OKAY in general and needed anything and no message back. Check socials and ive been unfollowed and unfriended on them all.\n\nWhy do people ghost without atleast telling the other person why? I know everyone is going through stuff, but why not at the minimum just say you need time alone or cannot be friends anymore or whatever? How am I supposed to now NOT think it was because of me? We are literally in the same school so of course I see you and you see me but then you walk by with your friends seemingly happy but dont even verbally recognize me. We were just friends, and I felt like we did great helping eachother out and checking up on one another, but dang this feels cruel. I would never do that to someone so why do that to me? It feels like middle school level behaviorism. Aren’t we all adults!?!?"

  "postTitle": "#66094 I just started grad school and somehow I feel like I have zero presence? People in my lab talk over me and forget about me when the lab does stuff together. I become socially overwhelmed super quickly now compared to undergrad and can't seem to power through my introversion and just do stuff. I don't know how a grad student is supposed to act, or what I'm supposed to do. My PI is helpful, but operates on a \"bring me problems or roadblocks and I will help solve them\" kind of system because he's so busy and I find it hard to identify my own problems. I feel like I'm stagnating right out the gate, and I'm not connecting with my lab or department like I think I should be. The older students in my lab seem so close with each other, but I find it really awkward to talk to them. My experience with research has been generally isolated due to covid and years of working remotely, so I've never had to deal with the social dynamics of a lab. Should I be spending more time in lab? How do I increase my presence?"

I rarely ever confess because I know it’s going to be a no, and I don’t want to deal with the awkwardness that’s pretty much guaranteed to ensue. Also sometimes I crush on underclassmen or members of a club that I’m on exec for, and the power dynamics at play don’t feel right, like even if they were to say yes. I guess I’m a big proponent of letting my crushes die? For the previous cases, in my opinion there’s always after MIT if you’re really interested in the person and want to pursue them without the icky power dynamics."

I value our time together and I can only hope that this isn’t too late. The signs of sadness and depression have not gone unnoticed. I worry for you, and I long to take away whatever pain and worries that may be clouding you. \n\nAll I can do for now is leave my confession here, and I pray that you may one day see and understand how I feel.

Why are we just letting them up the prices by like $500 in most of the dorms when they're taking away all of the common spaces and making rooms much smaller? It's going to be practically like a prison next year, with tiny rooms and no common spaces. No way this is \"market price\" housing. MIT do better."

  "postTitle": "#66155 So the craziest thing has been happening recently. The crazy thing is this: I feel fine. I don't feel sad. I don't feel intense-self-loathing. I don't feel exhausted, angry, like an imposter, or like I'm not enough. These feeling are usually a near constant and yet after Thanksgiving break I don't have them. I haven't been doing better in classes--in fact I am still struggling in a couple--i haven't been sleeping that much more, I haven't had a radical life change or started medication, and yet I feel fine, maybe even good?! It's so weird for me to feel this way, to experience this place with a positive filter on in my brain and I can't figure out what exactly put that filter there. Maybe it was the chance to recharge with family for a couple days? I almost feel guilty. Am I allowed to be ok when I know so many others are struggling right now? I have friends--not many but enough--and family who care about me, I have a personal project I enjoy and find stimulating, and I don't have to worry about having food to eat or a warm place to sleep. This is enough, I am enough, and I feel good. For the first time in my 3 years at MIT, I feel good. This place has brought me to my lowest lows but also some of my highest highs. Before the break I was questioning if this place was worth it. If the intense stress, sleep deprivation, and struggle were ever going to be worth experiencing. I don't know the answer to that, if the darkness is worth the moments of light. But for now, in this moment of light, I'm going to cherish what I have and remember I am ok."

So 2 rooms in the whole dorm are ADA accessible (although they’re probably forcing doubles or triples into those rooms next year…) Fun fact these renovations are also where the expanded high rise kitchens came from.\n\nBut yeah, really sorry you have to deal with this 😞",

But I'm happy for you to DM me, if you ever find yourself in a place where you just need someone to talk to.\n\nAnd yes: The fever, sickness, and stress from exams aren't helping. Those are all things that can make anxiety and depression kick into overdrive--and, for added fun, those two tend to mutually reenforce each other. Part of why you feel crappy is, well, you feel crappy. It's really hard for your mind to be happy when your body isn't. If you can, I recommend when you get those really overwhelming feelings to try to get up and move: Go for a walk outside, if you can. Dance badly (or well, if you're more talented than i am!) to music you like. Heck, just sway in place, if that's all you've got in you.\n\nAnd hang in there. One more final, you've got this.",

I didn't cry in a literal sense but I was in the super urop class and did 80% assignments there and still dropped this class since the research wasn't going well. I recall attempting everything and all I got was negative results. Looking back I realize that if I were doing that research now I would be a lot better addressing the failures or negative results. Things get better OP... And you do develop maturity over addressing failures or designing experiments or understanding/critiquing papers in more depth to find questions that are worth asking.  And from personal experience, when you do a lot of research, you have plenty of success and failures. Good luck OP! You got this",

Just because you don't walk by it every day doesn't mean it doesn't matter to someone. I think just two of these projects I listed exceed like ~500 housing units for grad students.",

  "text": "You're not alone, stay on the grind and hang in there. Job hunting sucks for everyone and when there are a hundred people applying for every job, we're all met with a sea of rejections before we find one. Reading that back it sounds less encouraging than I meant it to be, but it's true.\nUnless you happen to meet the right people with connections. You're not a failure, I think even a lot of us cruft have sent out a hundred resumes and not gotten a callback at some point. I know I have. It sounds like you're getting interviewed which is a great sign, just the fact that they called you in for interviews shows you're better than 95% of the candidates who applied. Especially in this economy, it's competitive out there in tech and even in better times, there are floods of resumes for a single position. Very few of them get an interview at all.\nJob hunting just sucks, it's hundreds of applications, a handful of interviews and if you're lucky some connections who can recommend you. It always feels like you're not getting anywhere as you see 99% of your work disappearing into the void and almost nobody has the decency to send a rejection email anymore. But you only need one good offer letter and when you get it, everything suddenly changes really fast to be good. \nAlso, these interviews are like exams, they're a poor judge of how successful you'll actually be in the future. Getting an F on one doesn't say anything about your worth. Also, if you get a B+ and someone else gets an A-, you'll still get rejected and never hear how close you were. \nGood luck, hang in there. I know getting rejected sucks and unfortunately job hunting involves tons of rejections. You'll make it eventually, just keep scrolling to the top of the newly posted positions and apply to like five or ten of them every day. You do have what it takes, it's just a competitive market. You're gonna be OK.",

I feel like I've tried everything over the past four months, from meeting with career services, grinding out dozens of practice problems, and asking people for advice. But everything I've learned and achieved at this university during the past three and a half years goes to waste as soon as I'm not able to solve the interviewer's math riddle that has nothing to do with the actual job. I feel so worthless not being able to provide for myself or my family. I feel like such a failure."

And taking action does not mean we are not grateful for not starving. If someone has dietary restrictions and dining is not meeting them, that person could, perhaps, be starving. And if they paid the same price as someone who has no dietary restrictions, they sure are not getting the same service. We should not stand for injustice, we should not let ourselves be scammed, and we should constructively complain and take action.

Lemme explain: any sort of action to punish students, such as Disciplinary Action, are and should be carried out in complete confidentiality, as per MIT rules. Meaning that whether MIT is or isn't taking direct action toward them is not going to be divulged in any kind of channel. The only thing we can rely on is if the students involved say they aren't receiving disciplinary action, which can only be taken as a fact if you believe they are saying the truth.",

  "postTitle": "#67716 Course 9 here:\nI generally love course 9. It is run really well, the content is interesting, and you can kind of put in however much work you want. However, 9.40 can go suck its own dick. \nFirst of all, it is a class that is literally computational cognition. It is a 6-9 class. Yet it is not required for course 6-9 and is instead only required for course 9 AND the course 9 minor. This leads to most people in the class complaining about it since none of us want to code and very few 6-9s taking it because of what they hear about it. \nSecond of all, the content is ridiculous. I am a double major in 18, and the content that we are learning is very much based in math, except that they don't have time to teach us the math, and try to get away with giving us a surface level understanding, then asking us to code it. It is nigh on impossible to code something that you don't understand. There should be many math prereqs to this class or it should be a grad class. The ideas are not difficult, they are just trying to do far too much and thus only teach us surface level anything but the psets and exams require an actual understanding of not just the ideas, but the math that the ideas are based upon. One of our problems on the first exam was to derive the 3D diffusion constant. \nThird, although the exams are open note and we have two hours to do them, they are 17 pages long. Image a 17 page long PSET. I don't care if that's open note but you're not gonna finish it in two hours. They say the questions are straightforward, but again, that is based on the assumption that we understand the math basis that they skim over in class. It's not even that the math is too difficult, it's just that each new concept requires a new math concept that should take at least 3 lectures to teach just the math. And it is evident that the professors themselves do not really understand the math as they are not good at answering specific questions about it such as edge cases, derivations, etc and instead tell us not to worry about it. We are expected to develop an understanding of something without ever being shown where it comes from. \nThe psets are often unclear in their questions and so are the exams, and the two are completely different so there is no real method of studying for the exams by doing the PSETS. It feels like the coding portion of this class is entirely unnecessary particularly considering it is not a 6-9 requirement. Things in this class are not explained well."

  "postTitle": "#67716 Course 9 here:\nI generally love course 9. It is run really well, the content is interesting, and you can kind of put in however much work you want. However, 9.40 can go suck its own dick. \nFirst of all, it is a class that is literally computational cognition. It is a 6-9 class. Yet it is not required for course 6-9 and is instead only required for course 9 AND the course 9 minor. This leads to most people in the class complaining about it since none of us want to code and very few 6-9s taking it because of what they hear about it. \nSecond of all, the content is ridiculous. I am a double major in 18, and the content that we are learning is very much based in math, except that they don't have time to teach us the math, and try to get away with giving us a surface level understanding, then asking us to code it. It is nigh on impossible to code something that you don't understand. There should be many math prereqs to this class or it should be a grad class. The ideas are not difficult, they are just trying to do far too much and thus only teach us surface level anything but the psets and exams require an actual understanding of not just the ideas, but the math that the ideas are based upon. One of our problems on the first exam was to derive the 3D diffusion constant. \nThird, although the exams are open note and we have two hours to do them, they are 17 pages long. Image a 17 page long PSET. I don't care if that's open note but you're not gonna finish it in two hours. They say the questions are straightforward, but again, that is based on the assumption that we understand the math basis that they skim over in class. It's not even that the math is too difficult, it's just that each new concept requires a new math concept that should take at least 3 lectures to teach just the math. And it is evident that the professors themselves do not really understand the math as they are not good at answering specific questions about it such as edge cases, derivations, etc and instead tell us not to worry about it. We are expected to develop an understanding of something without ever being shown where it comes from. \nThe psets are often unclear in their questions and so are the exams, and the two are completely different so there is no real method of studying for the exams by doing the PSETS. It feels like the coding portion of this class is entirely unnecessary particularly considering it is not a 6-9 requirement. Things in this class are not explained well."

I swear the canvas is mind boggling, cant find any files I need, syllabus is extremely confusing, everything is fucked. Im sure theyre smart, but these profs are not meant to be profs. TAs dont even know whats going on either, as profs dont tell them anything they need to actually cover. I heard they had to ask previous year professors for advice. That should just not happen. I hate this class and I’m hoping that this is just the shithole class of course 20 bc i really enjoy biology and the engineering behind it.\n\nBest of luck on the final other 20.110ers.

When I was in my worst and most sleep deprived semester, I remember feeling emotionally numb, feeling like I didn't have time to feel emotions. Bad times. Personally, learning self care (saying no to things, sleeping more, etc) helped me heal. At the very least, you have the end of the semester in sight and anytime can be a new start :)). Hang in there. But also if you think it will help, reaching out to mental health resources is always an option. You can check doingwell.mit.edu for some options.",

  "text": "that's a great question! tl;dr gravity also moves with the speed of light (as predicted by einstein's theory of general relativity), so if the sun were to hypothetically suddenly disappear, the earth would continue to orbit the \"old\" sun for 8 minutes (the time it takes for light to reach the earth). Since 2017, we even have experimental evidence that gravity indeed travels with the speed of light, as we have detected gravitational wave sources that we have simultaneously seen with a telescope.\n\nnote: The hypothetical situation where the sun suddenly disappears is not very realistic, as mass cannot just suddenly disappear, I guess you could just move the mass away from the earth very fast (up to the speed of light). You could also convert mass to energy (E=mc^2), but as far as I know, energy also exerts gravitational force, so I don't think it would affect gravity unless you move it.\n\nif you are interested to learn more:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMXhaI6bcrY&ab_channel=TheScienceVerse\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa_hLtPIE1s&ab_channel=Fermilab",

If something is \"traveling\" faster than the speed of light can't be used to convey information at that speed, then it might well be fine. \n\nFor example, if you had a very big whiteboard very far away and you moved the point of a laser pointer across it, the dot might be moving faster than the speed of light but that's fine because this fact will not allow you to convey information faster than the speed of light.",

I've taken 6.832 and am taking 6.800.  6.832 and 6.800 are maybe somewhat similar in that they both are taught by Prof Tedrake, but 6.832 focuses much more on dynamics and their control (Think about controlling a humanoid!). 6.800 focuses on all of the different software components of a robotic manipulation system. They overlap quite little in the concepts that are taught.\n\nTo my knowledge, 6.141 is quite different from both, where you work in teams to get a real robot to do things. I think you probably won't be working with an underactuated system nor manipulators, but of course a lot of the techniques are still relevant.  \n\nI love 6.832 and 6.800 and Prof Tedrake is great! Take them both! One is offered in the spring, and one in the fall.\n\n6.141 may be a better choice if you want to see a lot of the different parts that go into building a robot? Probably read the syllabus to all of them to get a sense of what goes into all of these classes in more detail!",

  "text": "Former TA for 6.141 here (also taken Underactuated and Manipulation):\nThey're all pretty different. 6.141 is very hands on. Students are assigned groups of 4-5 and get a fancy robot racecar to program. Assignments take 1-2 weeks and tend to culminate in a team final report and presentation (class is CI). The labs cover things like basic control, localization, perception, and planning. I'd say the most important thing is that you have programming experience with Python-- we don't really assume any robotics background.\n\nUnderactuated and Manipulation are both more research-focused, culminating in an open-ended research project for both. Each assignment usually has a few programming and a few theoretical questions. Manipulation focuses on perception, control, planning etc for robot arms (for the most part), while Underactuated talks more about robot locomotion. Latter class starts more on the theoretical control side before going into specific underactuated systems, like humanoids and cheetahs and stuff. There are a few topic overlaps between these two classes and 6.141, but the domains in which the topics are applied tend to be very different. Additionally, I found that Prof. Russ Tedrake talks a lot more about more \"researchy\" algorithms and approaches in his classes, whereas 6.141 covers more \"standard,\" long-standing approaches (though I think we usually end on some funky ML lectures at the end).\n\nBut yes, definitely take all three! If you've got more questions, feel free to message me as well! :D",

Then it also gives a scapegoat for people who might not go normally or have some barriers to going, since you can just blame it on MIT’s requirements and it would be covered by MIT."

Thus, at MIT, the sizes of humans are relatively uniform. Yes, there are short people and tall people, but encountering someone who is extremely short or extremely tall is exceedingly rare.

  "text": "I’d really suggest reaching out to a healthcare provider who can help you navigate your chronic pain in the context of your study/work. I’m sorry you feel a pressure to downplay your pain and that you’re finding it challenging! \n\nHere are a few things I found helpful. Make sure there are people who are readily available that you can reach out to for medical and mental support and/or to vent to when you need it (I found MIT medical really helpful). Build allowances into your work/study and social plans to focus on self care in case you need it (even if you don’t think you will right now). Try not to get swept up in drinking from the fire hose and ignore signs you need to slow down. Make supervisors that you trust aware of your challenges and ask for their support in planning around them. Try and celebrate your achievements even while you acknowledge the limitations your health puts upon you:  it’s no small thing to be at MIT while experiencing chronic pain. You rock, and I hope it gets easier soon.",

MIT really needs WiFi routers everywhere, and needs to be constantly checking all its networks to see if they’re down. So much of college and academic life depends on the internet and it’s ridiculous that this school of “technology” can’t even provide us reliable internet access."

  "text": "Since you mentioned that 70% of the C-suite in your company are alums from Stanford/MIT, I wonder if leadership is biased in promoting MIT folks over alums from other schools. I would also question the system of promotions, as not everyone wants to be a manager. It’s nice to have these privileges, but we should fight to eliminate bias in the workplace. If I was promoted over someone more competent due to MIT, I’d feel horrible. You mentioned giving back. Perhaps that means helping your colleagues get the salaries that they deserve.",

  "postTitle": "#66389 As a recent MIT alum, I feel incredibly fortunate to be working for a non-tech company with global reach and a revenue north of $25 billion, the kind that most of the students here would just gloss over. I was never someone special during my time here and when I graduated I felt uncertain about my future in comparison to my peers. But now, I have been promoted quickly, as did many of my peers from prestigious schools like Stanford and Carnegie Mellon. People who attended slightly less than elite universities like the University of Michigan, Georgia Tech, and Purdue, on the other hand, were not so lucky. Many of them are either languishing in lower positions or have been laid off during the current recession.\n\n The work at this company is incredibly easy; it does not exceed the demands placed upon me by MIT as a junior, which admittedly is still a high bar all considered, and I never work more than 30 hours a week. It's almost criminal how much simpler my time here at this non-tech company is, considering that I make about double what my peers from Georgia Tech get with just ~4 years of experience. This is despite the fact that they work much longer hours. I believe a non-trivial portion of this is due to the company being dominated by MIT alumni who have gone on to become McKinsey alums and that 70% of the C-suite in my company are undergraduate alums, from either Stanford or MIT.\n\nIf you’re anything like how I was during my time as an MIT student, this post will likely bring a tremendous sense of relief - but that relief will be quickly overshadowed by a heavy wave of guilt. We must not forget our privilege in this day and age: an MIT degree, particularly from Course 6, still serves as a coveted ‘golden ticket’ to the upper echelons of American society. There are only around a thousand humans in the world that get the opportunities every year in this planet inhabited by billions. Although the current recession has undoubtedly caused immense distress for many, for many MIT alum, it is merely a brief challenge.\n\nWith this in mind, I implore you to think of ways in which you can give back to the community that has given you so much. It is likely that you will likely gain far more from this institution than you will ever give in return despite the less-than-idea food and the occasional rodent. It may be difficult to have this outlook now, but your future self will be grateful for keeping things in the right perspective."

I've slept through fire alarms and construction noises and my neighbor drilling holes in our shared wall using an impact driver. But this snoring broke me. Kept me up all night, even with noice-canceling headphones on. The relentless sound of a chainsaw reverberating against my walls. Like trying to sleep next to a high-traffic airport runway. The most concerning part is, at one point the snoring suddenly... stopped? For a concerning amount of time, then started full force again. I took the L on sleep and spent the night psetting, then told him about it when he woke up, and he just brushed it off? Like dude, I legit think you're on the brink of dying in your sleep. This is no average snore. I've been roommates and bunkmates with many a snorer, I know what snoring should be. My dad has sleep apnea and his snoring is more bearable by several orders of magnitude. Pls help me convince this man his snoring and occasional not-breathing is a problem. If you see this, you know who you are, and please see a doctor about your snoring. If not for your own sake, for the sake of the people around you."

  "text": "If it's any consolation, i always struggled the most in the classes for my major. I failed a few classes, in my undergrad and in grad school, and i got turned down by quite a few internships along the way. It all worked out. \n\nIf you took three classes and worked as hard as you could and still didn't get above a B in any of them...that means you took three *hard* classes, all at the same time, and you worked really hard, and you did well. Try not to be too tough on yourself, you're doing fine.\n\nThis is going to sound trite, but somebody said it to me once when i needed to hear it, and it stuck with me: If you could do 100% all the time, then 100% wouldn't be exceptional; by definition, it'd be average. *Nobody's* average is 100%.",

  "text": "I don't deign to know what ADT is like nowadays, as I am literally THE cruftiest of ADT cruft. I just wanted to chime in to validate OP and #66153 in feeling like exec is cliquey. I don't particularly like the connotation of that word, as there is an implication of purposeful exclusivity and boundary; however, it would be silly to not admit that a sense of exclusivity *does* exist, by the very nature of it being an executive board. They literally spend hundreds of hours together every semester planning showcases/covers/events behind closed doors, in a process that most members do not see and cannot participate in. Folks on exec are probably more likely to be upperclassmen who have had more time in ADT overall (and therefore more time to find a friend group). They also are, by nature of being exec, individuals who have purposefully dedicated a large chunk of their time and energy into running a crazy huge student organization. When you are in a group of like-minded people, who are also crazy enough to do hundreds of hours of extracurricular service for free, who have had the time to bond through some pretty tough challenges... yeah, you ARE going to feel particularly close to them. And to folks on the outside, yes this DOES feel very exclusionary. I don't think the exclusion is on purpose, and I know when I was on exec we made every effort to do dance bonding events, impromptu boba runs/restaurant outings, I invited the whole team to parties at my apartment (I'll leave you to ponder the size of the team or the size of my apartment at the time).\n\nI don't think it's for lack of want to get to know you better. What exec group doesn't want to feel close to their members, to feel like they're doing a good job supporting a student organization they clearly care about? But ADT is HUGE nowadays, and by that nature it is definitely difficult, both for exec and for members to feel connected and embedded. I do believe most people eventually find their own place, and encourage newbies to try another semester or two before writing it off entirely. Usually folks will find their stride by their 2nd or 3rd semester when you're more familiar with how things run and who's who. Also, I don't know if y'all still have adt-spam, but if that still exists then I'd encourage you to just send out messages asking if folks want to join you for events/shenanigans/gaming/what have you.",

  "text": "Hi OP! Thank you so much for stepping forward and expressing your concerns towards ADT. Though we do our best to make ADT a friendly and welcoming organization, we aren’t perfect and are deeply sorry that the environment we established this semester wasn’t as inclusive as we wanted it to be.\n\nOur leadership team is prioritizing this issue as much as we can, and our captains and head choreographers are working very hard to address the concerns that have been brought up. With our showcase coming up and it being a busy time of the semester for everyone, we really appreciate your patience as we navigate this issue. We always welcome constructive feedback through the anonymous feedback form linked in the ADT Member Handbook, particularly if you have any specific events you can tell us about so we can work on concrete solutions!\n\nWe’re very grateful that you chose to join ADT this semester and the health and happiness of all our dancers is always our utmost priority. Thank you for helping us make ADT a place where dancers of all levels can come together to have fun <3",

  "text": "i don't mean to be tailing all the adt-cliqueyness confessions, and to be clear i don't speak on behalf of a single person besides myself (and /especially/ not adt exec, for whom i suspect i am prolly just creating a smol headache). BUT.\n\nOP (and other OP), i am not trying to dismiss your feelings about cliqueyness, but i guess i am saying there is no actual such a thing as \"cliqueyness\".\n\nyou seem to be saying that \"adt exec/leadership is cliquey, and this makes adt unwelcoming and non-inclusive\". well, what does it mean for adt exec to be cliquey, exactly? do you expect a group of people who spend a lot of time sharing the work of running an organization and maintaining a community to not become close friends with one another? do you expect people who are friends to... treat people who are not already their friends as openly and closely as they treat their friends? do you expect people to perform a social aesthetics of leadership at the expense of their personal social lives? i want you to really ask yourself: does \"cliquey\" mean anything besides \"is a group of friends\" && \"has social status\"?\n\nyou also say that adt is the biggest dance group on campus while simultaneously saying it is non-inclusive. what does that mean? how can both of those things be true? adt holds massive auditions that take like 25 people 20+ hours each to run, and accepts, tbh, more people than can comfortably fit in practice rooms. as an organization it is constantly taking action to allow for more members to join (like lowering the cap for number of dances per member). what would make it more inclusive and welcoming? in particular, what, beyond ppl performing a certain social aesthetics of leadership? i am pretty sure most members of adt leadership, like most members of adt, like most people at MIT, are introverts. what sort of social /work/ do they need to do to absolve themselves of the scarlet C for \"cliquey\"?\n\n(as a side note, you mention that \"it would not be a problem if it were a cliquey friend group\". smaller organizations basically /are/ just \"cliquey\" friend groups—adt leadership is only more notable in this regard /because/ the organization is more inclusive and welcoming and has more members!!!)\n\ni understand that is unpleasant to not be a part of a group that has social status in your life or community, and which therefore features prominently in your social awareness. but i also think it's important to recognize this feeling for what it is: envy. i'm sure there are all sorts of things adt could do to be /even more welcoming/ but i am very suspicious about pinning blame on its leadership being \"cliquey\", whatever that means.\n\nhere are a few relevant reads related to the point i'm trying to make about social groups and in-group envy:\n\n- the five geek social fallacies; an ancient blog post about how negative social experiences can warp our understanding of how social groups \"should work\": https://plausiblydeniable.com/five-geek-social-fallacies/\n\n- envy, by contrapoints; a lengthy video essay on recognizing envy and moving past it through, i guess, a sort of ecstatic sense of self: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPhrTOg1RUk\n\n(as you can see i am sort of a zealot about \"cliqueyness\" not being real. but hopefully some of these thoughts are informative... if not for OP then for someone out there.)",

I feel like those flaky christmas butter biscuits you aren't allowed to eat in the living room because the crumbs will get in the carpet. I feel like that thin layer of salad dressing that gets left on the top of the salad container after you shake your salad and you forget to throw out your salad box so it just sits on your desk for a week and the dressing dries up and gets all crusty but then you finally notice and touch it the wrong way trying to pick it up and it's  unexpectedly oily.

  "postTitle": "#68013 I feel like MIT has turned me into a master of banana-eating. I have a whole technique an everything. Instead of biting off chunks of banana and getting slimy banana teeth, peel the banana inch by inch and bite-size pieces will break off cleanly. You can do this with your mouth or your fingers, if you're feeling extra fresh n fancy. I peel the banana from the \"handle\", always. This is because the peelability of the handle bit indicates banana ripeness. If you struggle, the banana isn't ready. If it comes off too easily, the banana is overripe and not fit for immediate consumption and should be carefully carried back to the dorm for use in banana bread. Also, leaving a little bit of peel at the very end will allow you to break off the banana right before the weird hard bit at the end. I also swear by splitting the banana peel into 3 pieces, as this minimizes the extra peel strings that sometimes get stuck to the banana. I've also become a total banana snob. I now only eat perfectly yellow bananas with no green patches or spots. Sometimes if I'm feeling funky I shine a blacklight on the bananas to make sure there's no programmed cell death showing on the peel, indicating overripeness. I fear for my future when I will inevitably have to return to purchasing subpar bananas from the grocery store and suffering through green patches and dark spots on my bananas."

Is desk perfect? No. But anonymity is not an excuse to be an asshole. There is a difference between being constructive and being straight up rude, and that line was passed, on both sides, but what did you expect? Poke the bear, you get bitten. \n\nTLDR. Everyone should stop being an asshole and actually organize a conversation about the way desk is being ran if you want to see any change. \n\nAlso, Anon, you really should rethink your way of thinking. If you think work/money trumps peoples health, you really are fucked up. No wonder you didn’t post this on the actual email thread. Smh",

You're right, we don't get to go on fancy boat rides in Europe, but hey, there's another face to it. You made it here on your own merit with the limited resources we had. No one will ever take that away from you. You'll be the change in your family and you will bring great success and prosperity to your future one. I can tell you it turns around. After a lot of work and perseverance, I obtained an internship that will allow me to earn more in a summer than my mom makes in a semester. And I'm so excited to help her with her expenses and finally be able to give back everything that she gave to me, even when money was lacking. Don't forget about what your family has done for you, and let them be an inspiration for your own resilient story. Money and success will come as a byproduct, you got it!",

And I totally get feeling a little scared, I also felt that before my first game (LARPing felt like one of those things I'd call \"intimidatingly quirky\") but that fear was gone almost instantly when I started playing. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.\n\nAnd as others have said, I've also never heard of someone being bullied over the Assassins' Guild. As Dasha said, most stuff you can do at MIT can probably fall under “the kind of thing that people got bullied for in high school.”",

It's a type of story-telling you really get through no other medium with people who will commit to the acting as much as you do. You're at MIT, people are mature (and nerdy) enough to not bully others. The game that ran over IAP we still talk about months later because it just has so much story potential and the memories I formed with my new friends here I'll never forget.",

  "text": "In the interactions you have you can show affection and say that you wish the best for her, and say some things you admire about her in the birthday message. But what works for me is trying to pass some time without thinking about the person. You want the crush to go away, so you want her to just be a good friend, you don't want to have a romantic attraction to the person. Think about a good friend of yours. How many times per day do you think about the person? Maybe a couple per day, and even when you think about them you don't do it for too long, so that's what you have to do with her. In a first moment, for me, it helps to stay a month without messaging first, then I think the feeling should start to feel better, if not, just continue doing it. When you think about the person, just let the thought pass by, don't keep it in your mind making further questions about it or imagining situations. IAP and summer are ideal moments to do that because you are naturally distant from the person",

(2) As others mentioned, directly emailing grad students is even more optimal. (3) IMO the most efficient way to get a UROP is to reach out to professors you are taking classes with/are being advised by whose research interests you - this is how i got into both of my UROPs so far",

  "text": "Don't feel discouraged! When I was a first year graduate student, I emailed some professors three times without getting a response. They are not necessarily ghosting, but may just be flooded with 100+ emails a day. Two nice tricks I learned from a mentor that may be helpful: (1) when you don't get a response after a while, try sending a reminder titled \"Second try: blahblah\". These flags can catch their attention. (2) Try to keep your emails short and crisp. Super long explanations of why you are passionate about their research probably decrease the chances of them reading your email. (3) When possible, sneak into their office hours in person. Hard to ghost you when you are standing right in front of them!",

If you're in course 6, it's likely that you will have to email multiple times before they respond.\n2. Emailing the professors (in course 6) is suprisingly often not going to result in an answer (mostly because they're busy) unless you know the professor. So I'd suggest emailing a grad student in their lab (high chances of a reply if they have a posting for a urop on elx with the grad student's email listed). \n3. Asking your advisor or an upperclassman you know for help/reference is always a good idea.\n4. Freshmen don't really get that many urops unless they come out of hs with legit skills or they are applying for urops that don't require legit skills.\n5. Responsiveness also varies widely based on when you email about urops.\n6. Feel free to reach out to me op; I might be able to help :)",

That some of our students have *visible, googleable* markers of success does not by itself distinguish their internal experience of MIT from yours. \n\nProfessor Guo has written about a related set of problems with those who are assumed to be competent or incompetent based on race and gender: https://slate.com/technology/2014/01/programmer-privilege-as-an-asian-male-computer-science-major-everyone-gave-me-the-benefit-of-the-doubt.html\n\nI am not trying to invalidate your feelings — they are real and they are common. But I am trying to explain how the salience of certain categories or markers gives this feeling the solidity of fact when it is really more complex than that.",

I don't know if there is a solution, but OP, it's good to be aware that just about everyone feels this way and you are brilliant, the admission board did not make a mistake, you are not one of the dumb ones.

  "postTitle": "#66097 Hopefully this gets posted by tomorrow. We have a presentation on our final project and this one guy did absolutely nothing and has to have an equal time of talking during the presentation. I assigned the slides that I worked so hard on and it pains me that someone else is going to talk about my and someone else's work and get credit for it when they didn't do anything. Yes we did reach out to him and try to get him involved, and yes he did give one-word answers. I am so close to emailing the instructors, but I don't want to be a snitch and it is going to be over tomorrow. What do I do?"

(I also wouldn't even really say that MIT is prominent in defense work, unless you're thinking of Lincoln Labs.) It's not that research subsidizes education. Research loses money and education also loses money. Both just consume resources, they don't generate net extra resources. Some people naively look at MIT's indirect cost rate of about 55% and think this means that somehow for every dollar of research grants that MIT receives, it gets an extra 55 cents to keep and spend on whatever it wants. But that's not how it works at all. The 55% rate is computed because that's what it actually costs MIT in indirect costs to support each dollar of research. Research grants at best pay for the costs of research, and often fall short. Maria Zuber has a good primer:\nhttps://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/295/zuber.html",

  "postTitle": "#66527 Reclining seats in the economy section of a plane should be illegal. Yes I know the seats don't recline that much. But I'm tall and I feel like having to spend an entire flight with my knees mashed into the back of a seat, breathing the musty air emanating off the top of someone's head is a human rights violation. Also I would prefer if I could have an actually usable tray table. You know, that I can place a cup on. Or a laptop. Once someone reclines a seat I am then locked into one position, physically unable to move my lower body or reach my personal items stowed under the seat in front of me for the remainder of the flight. Never in my life have I reclined an airplane seat, except during nighttime on an incredibly long redeye international flight when everyone else is also reclined. It's just immoral.\n\nNow I understand some people have back problems that make sitting in an unreclined position unpleasant. And not all people with back problems are rich. I get it. An easy solution would be to have a dedicated section of seats that can actually recline. Left half recline, right half upright or something. People who recline should deal with each other. Nobody deserves to infringe on the space behind them while also having the privilege of sitting behind a non-recliner. \n\nOr we force airline companies to stop shrinking seats because a reclined seat should not pose such a huge problem. Is this just another tool to incite intra-class conflict and get the lower classes to fight each other while the privileged elite in economy plus sit in comfort? Except even economy plus has been subjected to agressive legroom shrink lately. Honestly, economy plus is a ridiculous construct. Let's artificially shrink most of the economy seats and keep a few so we can upcharge people $100 to sit in \"\"comfort\"\". Except the comfort is just the luxury of having as much space as normal economy used to have. The people will be cramped. The carryon luggage won't fit in the overhead bin. I remember when just a few years ago having empty spots in overhead bins was the norm. It was also normal to see a few empty seats here and there. Now we're plagued with overfilled bins and forced gate-checking and aggressive overbooking and kicking people off the plane when everyone actually shows up for their overpriced flight. \n\nAlso economy basic is some bullshit. We used to roast Spirit airlines and Frontier for pulling this no carryon luggage shit. Now everyone's doing it. Delta. United. They've constructed a lower lower class who can't bring anything on the plane but their bodies and are assigned middle seats and have to board at the very end. They're paraded down the aisle in all their no carryon excuse-me-I'm-in-the-middle-seat-can-you-please-move-your-legs glory right at the end to be the subject of public shaming. They're the last to board and the first to go if the plane is overbooked. Forget economy plus, now even economy is luxury. All thrown into a pit together where the seat recliners and non-recliners will fight and stew and hate each other while business class actually enjoys their flight."

We used to roast Spirit airlines and Frontier for pulling this no carryon luggage shit. Now everyone's doing it. Delta. United. They've constructed a lower lower class who can't bring anything on the plane but their bodies and are assigned middle seats and have to board at the very end. They're paraded down the aisle in all their no carryon excuse-me-I'm-in-the-middle-seat-can-you-please-move-your-legs glory right at the end to be the subject of public shaming. They're the last to board and the first to go if the plane is overbooked. Forget economy plus, now even economy is luxury. All thrown into a pit together where the seat recliners and non-recliners will fight and stew and hate each other while business class actually enjoys their flight."

It's not like y'all will get married and she can just avoid them for the rest of your lives. It's not going to get better, and should you want kiddos, think of how traumatic it would be for them to see Mom and Grandparents displaying animosity between them. My current partner respects my parents 100% and I get along well with his, and it is night and day difference from my ex.

(personally the meal plan is very low cost/value for me and the block 125 is an additional $500/month, but ymmv.) unfortunately studios are in very high demand so it'll still be much cheaper to sublet rooms (around 800-1200) or get a roommate",

I think a studio or 2 bed is gonna be a lot harder to find for affordable price. Also, use your network! Ask friends that have graduated or friends that have friends that have graduated. Word of mouth goes very far, and that way you find roommates that are vetted good people too. Like someone else said, surrounding areas are also cheaper, and if you have a bike or good T access it’s not too bad to commute.\n\nGood luck!!",

I don't even make $1700 a month how is one supposed to afford this ahhh\n\nAnyone have advice on finding roommates or apartments for $1250 a month per room or less?? Or working with brokers? Or getting assistance? Is this even possible, lol? I just want to know if I should give up trying to live outside of the dorm/FSILG system at a reasonable price while still being able to have my own room."

Consider: it is very in-character for Harvard students to enforce a prescriptivist linguistic ideal and pronounce the COOP as \"co-öp\". It is simultaneously in-character for MIT students to give zero flying fucks and choose the funnier/descriptivist pronunciation, therefore leaning hard into calling it the \"coop\", like a chicken coop. To add to this point, to my knowledge, only the Harvard Square COOP has signage specifically outlining the \"co-öp\" pronunciation, while this specific information does not exist at any of the MIT locations. The \"co-öp\"/\"coop\" distinction will also help enforce a healthy divide between the Harvard and MIT versions of the COOP. For this reason, I will proudly continue to call it the \"coop\" and encourage my fellow MIT affiliates to do so.

  "postTitle": "#67665 Sometimes when life as a PhD student gets too hard I like to pretend that I have dedicated my life to a higher power and my academic work is a set of strict religious duties that I must fulfill to cleanse my soul. Sleep deprivation? Eating 1 meal a day? Living in a tiny barren room with only the bare necessities? Abandoning all monetary wealth and worldly possessions? All in the name of the holy, omniscient, and omnipresent gears of science. I teach my students and research assistants with all the zeal and passion in my heart in the hopes that they may, one day, also walk my path. I dedicate my life to understanding the truth of the universe and converting people to my subfield as it is objectively the most interesting and worthy discipline out of all scientific disciplines which exist now and in the potential future. My one true wish in life is to tap into a rich vein of undiscovered knowledge so revolutionary that all will seek my wisdom as a vessel of scientific authority. \n\nMaybe I've been half-watching too many cult documentaries as background noise for my experiments."

  "text": "that more whole version of you may well return after you graduate; I hope it does. \n\nas I wrote to a prior graduating class: \n\n“hi y’all –\nright, most of you are probably struggling into weird robes and wizard hats and getting ready to get in line to get in line to get in line again.\nbut it wasn’t all that long ago that you were all bumbling around in this group like a bunch of puppies, all small and excitable and if truth be told somewhat unpleasant smelling and not yet potty trained but nonetheless probably worth it to welcome into our home.\nyou all were the second class that i helped admit but the first one where i was really involved or had any idea what was going on or what this place was and what you would all one day mean to it (and to me). and over the past few years, including a period of time where i myself enrolled as a student and become acutely aware of the dual meaning of IHTFP, you all came to mean more than i can say. i graduated in summer 2013, and it probably took me until fall 2014 before i started feeling ‘like myself’ again; until i had decompressed enough from the experience that i could really synthesize who i had been and what the Institute had made me into a unified person i could recognize in the mirror.\nas i grad student, when i was at my lowest, i sat down with one of my former advisees and apologized for admitting him. i said that he could have gone anywhere else and he would have been happier and i felt guilty i helped make the case why he ought to come to MIT. and he politely told me i was a condescending idiot and that he *could* have gone to plenty of other places, but he chose here because he wanted to be broken down and rebuilt, and sometimes it sucked, but that’s what was happening. and that’s when i realized that all of you (whether or not you are graduating today, and no matter what is happening next) are more wonderful, capable, intelligent, enduring people than i had ever fully apprehended or appreciated.\ni wrote this to the students in cms.400 this past spring, but it really holds true for all of you:\n“MIT is a hard place, made all the harder for the resonant, omnipresent, pounding self-consciousness of how hard it is. This semester more than most. At MIT in general, and this semester specifically, you have all been through an experience that has marked you deeply, even as you endured it.\nThe etymology of the word ‘endure’ traces to a 1382 English translation of Acts 19:9: “Summe weren endurid, or maad hard.” But the word has two distinct meanings: to be made callous and indifferent, or to become sturdy, robust, strengthened. As a grad student (and in the immediate afterward), I struggled, not always successfully, to resist the pull of the former in favor of the latter. Whether you graduate in a few weeks, or in a few years, I hope that you can do that too.”\ni don’t sleep with my grad rat on. one reason is so that, when i get up every morning, and get ready to go out into the world, the small ritual of slipping it on reminds me to be my best person: the most intelligent, rigorous, enduring, yes, but also the most humane, the most empathetic, the person most worthy of the privileges and obligations that a place like MIT confers and also a place like MIT needs. because the rest of the world is in desperate need of people who are all of those things: intelligent *and* kind, hardworking *and* humane, capable *and* considerate, etc. the ring is not necessary for this kind of reflection, of course, but i have personally found it a useful shibboleth. when you go to turn your rat around today, please, take a moment, just a moment, to think about how you will make the world suck a little less when you’re out there in it. because that’s really all any of us can do on a day to day basis: try to make the world suck a little less.\nin the amber spyglass, will and lyra are told:\n“And if you help everyone else in your worlds to do that, by helping them to learn and understand about themselves and each other and the way everything works, and by showing them how to be kind instead of cruel, and patient instead of hasty, and cheerful instead of surly, and above all how to keep their minds open and free and curious…” then tldr the world will be ultimately OK, or as OK as it can be, and this is what you can do. and this isn’t mawkish or or maudlin or sentimental because it is so painfully and incredibly true.\ni am going to go now, because i am working your commencement, and it would probably be a good idea to put on pants. i will see many of you there. but please know that i am more grateful than i can say for having the chance to know yow, and more hopeful for the world that you are all about to enter.\n– me”\n\nhttps://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mit-class-of-2015-graduates-from-mit/",

  "postTitle": "#66257 MIT dining lately has been forcing me to eat out of survival and it's severely impacting my happiness. Like I don't want to eat anything on the menu because I rarely find something that is not pure carbs, oily, or fried, but I know if I don't eat I will starve. It's so bad and so expensive and I can't believe I'm being forced to buy so many meal swipes. Every time I go to dining, I leave in a worse mood because of the terrible meal and dining experience in general (not enough plates, workers are sometimes kinda mean, etc). During such a busy part of the semester, sometimes my meals are the only time I can get a break from work and it sucks that I can't even enjoy that time because I'm too upset with dining."

  "postTitle": "#66304 Why do MIT dining halls keep putting honeydew in the fruit mixes?? NOBODY likes how few. It is ALWAYS the worse fruit in any fruit mix. Everyone likes graoes, everyone likes cantaloupes, everyone likes pineapples. All of these three fruits go great with granola and yogurt to make an excellent breakfast parfait. Delicious flavorful fruits that are just about RUINED by virtue of just being next to a piece of honeydew, the shitty cantaloupe KNOCKOFF that doesn’t even have ANY FLAVOR. I’m paying like $20 for every meal at these fucking dining hAlls so don’t I deserve a GOOD FUCKING BREAKFAST?? And they don’t even have the fruits in separate bowls so I can pick and choose which ones I want to eat in the morning, it’s all mixed together. The fact that MIT dining can get away with this is borderline criminal."

Everyone likes graoes, everyone likes cantaloupes, everyone likes pineapples. All of these three fruits go great with granola and yogurt to make an excellent breakfast parfait. Delicious flavorful fruits that are just about RUINED by virtue of just being next to a piece of honeydew, the shitty cantaloupe KNOCKOFF that doesn’t even have ANY FLAVOR. I’m paying like $20 for every meal at these fucking dining hAlls so don’t I deserve a GOOD FUCKING BREAKFAST?? And they don’t even have the fruits in separate bowls so I can pick and choose which ones I want to eat in the morning, it’s all mixed together. The fact that MIT dining can get away with this is borderline criminal."

It's just a simple day or worse (considering we are one year forward to our death).\nAnyway, I don't want anyone to know about my birthday. I don't want to celebrate it.\nFor the last few years, I almost stayed 15-20 hours outside home to avoid tons of birthday parties of myself. I donated almost all the gifts except some.\n\nAnyway, I don't like birthday and I don't like anyone to celebrate it.\n\nThat's my 2 cents.. call me unsocial or anything but I don't need to live my life abiding your rules or your definition of \"social\"!!!",

  "text": "Happy Birthday♥♥♥. Do u know something very strange and at a time interesting!?. 2 years back, when my bestfriend used to forget my birthday second time in a row ( I'm sharing this cuz im seeing myself in u) and wishing me, I used to call her and all of my frnds whom I considered my closests and make them wishing me happy birthday with the song. 😩😣bleehhh. Things have changed a lot now. Now I no longer stick to ppl and at least try not to expect much from them. Now I think everyday is ur birthday if u can spend the day happily ( though I'm not that much of strong person, but atleast I'm trying not to depend on others emotionally cause that hurts a lot) Even I used be that kind of a person who will make sure to wish each and every person \"happy birthday \" From her frndlist exact at 12am  , I always wanted to be the first to wish cause myb that makes me feel sooo good inside cause I really love to see ppl smile or being happy even after their on the other side of the phone. \nSo The Happiest Birthday to u Good Soul♥♥.\nBe happy by ur own. Cause no ppl can make u happy for any longer. Life is a harsh battlefield. Don't feel lonely, u r the sweetest cuppycake💝, u deserve the bestttttt🫶🫶",

It generates a particular damaging sense of loss called \"ambiguous grief\" which can really harm the other person, making them feel guilty, uncertain, insecure, and untrusting of others in the future.   It's a horrible feeling---as I know from experience.    If you're ending (any kind of) a relationship, you owe it to the other person to explain why.   https://socialself.com/blog/social-life-companion/the-grief-of-being-ghosted/",

To return the shopping cart is objectively right. There are no situations other than dire emergencies in which a person is not able to return their cart. Simultaneously, it is not illegal to abandon your shopping cart. Therefore the shopping cart presents itself as the apex example of whether a person will do what is right without being forced to do it. No one will punish you for not returning the shopping cart, no one will fine you or kill you for not returning the shopping cart, you gain nothing by returning the shopping cart. You must return the shopping cart out of the goodness of your own heart. You must return the shopping cart because it is the right thing to do. Because it is correct.\n\nA person who is unable to do this is no better than an animal, an absolute savage who can only be made to do what is right by threatening them with a law and the force that stands behind it.\n\nThe Shopping Cart is what determines whether a person is a good or bad member of society.",

We have been forced to work through the night, sacrificing sleep, food, and personal time to meet the arbitrary demands of these deadlines. We have been conditioned to accept these deadlines as normal and necessary, but we know the truth: they serve no purpose other than to exert control over our lives.\n\nWe demand an end to the tyranny of 11am pset deadlines. We demand the right to set our own schedules and work at our own pace. We demand the right to prioritize our physical and mental health over arbitrary deadlines. We demand the right to learn without being constantly stressed and exhausted.\n\nWe recognize that some may argue that these deadlines are necessary to ensure that work is completed on time. However, we reject this argument. We believe that deadlines should be flexible and designed to encourage learning and creativity, not just to meet a bureaucratic requirement.\n\nWe call on our professors and academic institutions to recognize the harm that 11am pset deadlines cause and to take action to address this issue. We urge them to implement more flexible and humane deadlines that prioritize learning, mental health, and well-being.\n\nWe also call on our fellow students to stand with us in solidarity and demand change. We must collectively reject the notion that 11am pset deadlines are necessary and work together to create a culture of learning that values our health and well-being.\n\nWe will not be oppressed by 11am pset deadlines any longer. We demand change, and we will not rest until we achieve it."

  "postTitle": "#67819 I never knew what it felt like to be dumb until I came here. I was always at or near the top of my class at a so-called \"rigorous\" high school, but more importantly than the grades was the fact that I often could understand things without trying too hard. I rarely needed help to solve my homework; in fact, I was the person people asked for help. Everyone said I was smart, my grades said I was smart, so I unwisely started to believe it. In fact, it became one of the traits I defined myself by, something I foolishly built my sense of self around. And then I came here, and that all crumbled. I'm doing poorly in all my classes this semester. I simply do not understand what is happening is several of them. I just can't wrap my head around the material, and even less apply it to PSETs. I've become the one begging people to help me. I'm in danger of failing some of my classes. I mean, I think it doesn't hurt to have a good humbling sometimes and know that there are people better than you at everything, but holy shit, I didn't need my self-worth and identity to be pounded into the ground too. I don't even know what to do anymore. At this point maybe I should drop out and let someone who actually deserves to be here take my place."

  "postTitle": "#66380 This is my first confession so I hope I do this right.  This goes out to the person that lost their mom after coming out to her. I am a mom, and I want you to know that you touched many of the hearts on the parents board. I don't think I will come here again as it feels a little creepy, like this should be a place for students to have a little fun and help each other through the day, not for us moms. But, I felt compelled to respond to you. I can tell you that your mom loved you and was proud of you. I can tell you that she felt that way no matter what you say or do, nothing can change that.  I can tell you that in her last moments, her only thought was that she wished she could have made things right with you too and that she could have told you that. Moms are people too and we make mistakes.  I think its not so much that we don't trust our kids or approve of our kids, its more fear, fear of them getting hurt and making decisions that would affect them for a lifetime. It doesn't make the reaction right or excusable, but sometimes our first response is just that ... fear for our kids and just wanting to protect them. I can tell you from experience that I made mistakes with my own daughter.  I wish I could take it all back, and I've tried, but she doesn't want anything to do with me.  I miss her so much, but I am still so proud of her and love her more than anything. You should know that your mom felt the same way. Even if she couldn't tell you, she loved you and was proud of you. In time, I do think she would have realized that she needs to let you live your life the way you want and that you don't necessarily need mom in the same way as you did growing up.  That's hard for us moms too. She would want you to not have regrets, to know she loves you more than anything just the way you are, and to go on and have a happy life.  She would want you to be happy.  To live your life, to the fullest, knowing in your heart she loved you, is the best way to make things right with her now."

I can tell you that in her last moments, her only thought was that she wished she could have made things right with you too and that she could have told you that. Moms are people too and we make mistakes.  I think its not so much that we don't trust our kids or approve of our kids, its more fear, fear of them getting hurt and making decisions that would affect them for a lifetime. It doesn't make the reaction right or excusable, but sometimes our first response is just that ... fear for our kids and just wanting to protect them. I can tell you from experience that I made mistakes with my own daughter.  I wish I could take it all back, and I've tried, but she doesn't want anything to do with me.  I miss her so much, but I am still so proud of her and love her more than anything. You should know that your mom felt the same way. Even if she couldn't tell you, she loved you and was proud of you. In time, I do think she would have realized that she needs to let you live your life the way you want and that you don't necessarily need mom in the same way as you did growing up.  That's hard for us moms too. She would want you to not have regrets, to know she loves you more than anything just the way you are, and to go on and have a happy life.  She would want you to be happy.  To live your life, to the fullest, knowing in your heart she loved you, is the best way to make things right with her now."

Its otherworldly sound, with its crystalline purity and ethereal resonance, transcends the mundane and transports the listener to a realm of sheer beauty and wonder. Alas, it is a realm that remains beyond the grasp of the 'forte-issimo ignoramus', who is doomed to languish in the aural banality of the commonplace, deaf to the celestial harmonies of the harpsichord's exquisite perfection."

Alas, it is a realm that remains beyond the grasp of the 'forte-issimo ignoramus', who is doomed to languish in the aural banality of the commonplace, deaf to the celestial harmonies of the harpsichord's exquisite perfection."

  "text": "I was the same until God changed my desires to heal on my own first — as my desire to be with someone to “heal” them was a projection of how I deeply wanted to be healed as well from my own self-sabotage, but I felt that I needed to prove it myself to “be the change I want to see” or bring into existence what I craved — so I tried to be that person to someone else before I even dealt with my self-sabotage. It’s crucial you realize that all goes well and great until the long-term of your tendency to self-sabotage. You already know what you need to work on — and after only knowing failed and toxic relationships, I’ve started my journey step-by-step with God, healthy community & support, as well as guidance from mentors — individuals and/or couples who have healthy relationships, as well as therapy. I will say therapy has been helpful in acknowledging & identifying the issues + discovering coping mechanisms — I’ve been recently dealing with PTSD + OCD-like symptoms (as my therapist identified) due to a lot of trauma in past relationships, which felt nearly impossible to overcome. I’d isolate myself and try to deal with it myself, as I thought asking for help would counteract my beliefs in my identity as one who wants to be the one to heal people. But the true changes have only been possible due to the strength & love from God (who is always with us, even in the loneliest times) + healthy, loving communities around me. I’m so ever grateful, and now taking steps towards healing, I feel so much more equipped to give & make contributions towards those seeking healing as well 😊🙏🏼 We learning and growing together\n\nAll being said, your desire to be a healer is not toxic, and is rather admirable — we need more people like you who want to pour in love, especially with all the depths of suffering in our world. But you cannot pour from an empty cup. I hope my insight offered some perspective, as I relate heavily with you. Please PM me if you’d like to talk more or meet ❤️ you got this, and God got you!\n\nFinally, I hope you continue to seek your own healing — posting this was a brave first step — and trust me, it’s a very humbling but the most worthwhile process… and your desires may begin to change as well. (I’m growing to be attracted to people who pursue their own healing as well, so it’s not all on me to heal them — in interdependence ❤️)",

When they lash out and hurt me, I retreat emotionally. This starts a cycle of hurt that can only end with us separating. But these are the only people I've been able to love.

  "text": "I've struggled with being drawn to people because i thought i could \"heal\" them, and in my case i found there were two main underlying causes--one of which was mostly okay, one that wasn't.\n\nThe \"okay\" one was, i wanted to be the person *i* had needed. It felt good to give other people the support and care that i had needed and lacked. I don't think that's a bad impulse to have--it makes for a kinder world, and is so much better than \"If i had to suffer, so should everyone else\". The trick, i think, is not to slip into a saviour-complex about it.\n\nThe not-okay side was, i was turned off from people who (in my estimation) didn't \"need healing\" from me because they made me feel insecure: What could this person possibly *want* from me, if they don't *need* me? I can't give you easy advice about how to unpack that, it's a journey; but i can say that digging into the false assumptions and insecurities that thinking was rooted in really helped me to form healthier relationships.\n\nIt's possible your underlying needs and motivations are quite different from mine, so i don't know whether you'll find any of that useful. But i'm glad you felt comfortable and confident enough to talk about it!",

  "postTitle": "#66341 I realized I have a strong preference for people who hate the world or have been hurt by it. People who are witty in order to hide their pain. I want to be their comfort and take care of them. I want to be their only one, a light in their dark world that they love and also care for. I hate that I grew up being praised for reading when I was just reading YA fiction in my formative years. I've created this unrealistic person in my head that I want to be with. Basically, I want the main character's damaged but beautiful love interest. \n\nIn reality, I'm not selfless enough to care for someone because I'm so focused on my own problems, which pale in comparison and are often self-imposed. I'm self-sabotaging and preventing myself from being with good people because they don't fit this image, but I genuinely can't find myself attracted to them unless there's some way I can \"\"heal\"\" them. It's mildly toxic and I hate myself for it. \n\nIn practice, the people I want to be with start out wanting to be with me because they see me as innocent and naive. They want to protect me from the losses and pain they endured. And I love being protected by them and giving them a shoulder to lean on and lending an ear. Those moments of bliss mean everything to me. But it never works out long term because they get frustrated that I choose to self-sabotage and create problems when there are bigger issues to deal with.

I think the recent confessions about ADT have some merit, and I’m not here to judge either side because I think exec puts in a lot of fucking work and should not be expected to be besties with even 1/5 of the population of ADT. At the same time, it’s really easy for new members to feel left out especially when they’re not friends with a lot of people in ADT.

  "text": "Most MIT depts give grad students ~ 40k which is more than enough to live comfortably in Boston alone if you accept a moderate commute or roommates, and can even manage to support two people if you squeeze (how many grad students have a dependent to support entirely on their stipend anyway?)\n\nThere's plenty of organizational things MIT can do that don't cost extra money like not having grad tuition and stipend come out of grants (which makes us beholden to PIs and specific grants, or fellowships), or places where MIT can use its local power to help us (transport costs, legal/organizational help with housing), or places where MIT can collecively do for cheaper what is more expensive for each of us individually (healthcare, especially emergency expenses which can bankrupt an individual but MIT has lawyer power to contest).\n\nBut just demanding more money in a free, functional labor market shows a desire for a fight more than for solutions.\n\n(also, reminder than \"union shop\" is a euphemism for \"we want you to have to pay us fees even if you're not a member or don't want to be involved\")",

  "text": "OP, sounds like you're just not that interested in EE lol... what motivated me to choose 6-1/8-flex was my interest in areas like nanotechnology and quantum computing that draw on both subjects heavily. And this is just two of the COUNTLESS areas where EE and physics come together (RF, optics, semiconductors, just to name a few more). As a 6-1, the 8 classes give me a better understanding of what's going on \"under the hood\" while having those EE skills allows me to apply the more theoretical side of physics to something concrete-- do you know how many physicists are looking for those with EE backgrounds? 6-1/8-flex exists because of that natural overlap between the two and just how popular the combo was so a program that defines how to get the most out of both majors clearly is incredibly useful. Fortunately for you, 8-flex is specifically designed to make double majoring with 8 a little easier course load wise, so if 6-2/8 is something you're into, meet with the flex coordinator to start figuring out your courses and concentration!! At the end of the day, 6-1/8 or 6-2/8 it's still a double major and a shit ton of work regardless if the track exists or not.",

In other words: Live in the moment because the decisive actions you take now will have the strongest impact on where you end up down the road. Accept and embrace the things that you can't change and rather than dwelling on them, plan around them. Never lose sight of your dreams and look forward to moving towards them. Lastly, while you shouldn't spend too much time thinking on the past, reflection is essential. This goes both ways. Honestly evaluate what you could have done differently but don't take for granted what you've accomplished already. We're here after all so you must have done something right. Believe in yourselves, this world is ours!"

It’s such a hard thing to go through, but I’ve been able to find some solace in having a community of friends (and having people that “get it” because…most young people don’t have to deal with this and don’t know how to react). My dms are open and I would be honored to share in this grieving journey with you 💙 If you want to talk or connect i am here for you!",

  "text": "Tl;dr: Laura is (in my experience) one of the most understanding admins at MIT. I hate 3.091 and the way it is structured but my grievance is not with her, as she has no control over that. \n\nEdit: I feel like such a suck-up for this and I genuinely hate it when people do this but I felt like it had to be said as it is one of the two chem GIR classes and you shouldn’t be afraid of choosing 3.091 based on OPs experience and that’s basically what Im trying to say here \n\nOkay I literally never do this to defend faculty because normally I couldn’t care less. I’m a sophomore in 3.091, I have had one of the shittiest semesters ever like to the point where S^3 just tells me to request anything I need and they will approve it and I will just meet biweekly with them (just to show how much). Laura was by far the most understanding. Idk your approach OP but I went out of my way to talk to her right at the beginning of everything that was going on, to open basically that line of communication (which i’m not necessarily saying OP should’ve done, it’s just important for the point i’m going to make). Laura has basically had to move each of my exams (Exam 2 was moved by three weeks because I needed it) and multiple quizzes, and then proctors them each time even though I have time and a half and a private room for exams (adhd lol). So she has to go out of her way a lot for me, but she did it because I needed her to do it. We talk about this often, whenever I’m waiting for her to tie up the work she’s doing so I can do my quiz, that she hates being the bad guy but sometimes with hundreds of people in the class, she has to be as the logistics will never ever work out, if she has to move everything for everyone. OP, I imagine your experience is a bit of an anomaly because this woman is so busy all of the time trying to sort things out for students in the class and I often sit in her office (waiting for my exam) whilst she writes up emails trying to help everybody she can. I have never seen a more overworked admin assistant. In my experience, Laura has been hands down the most understanding administrator at MIT and has gone out of her way to help me every time I have needed it. The most recent example is that she helped me get another accommodation from DAS as she recommended it in the first place (I didn’t even know it was something they could do) based on the fact I told her that I was really struggling to concentrate even more than usual. \n\nWe actually talked about the 8am makeups whilst going to do my Exam 3. She is genuinely so busy and the only time that for sure works for everybody who needs a makeup is before classes start, as she can’t be doing multiple make ups for quizzes and exams. I’ve never had an 8am makeup based on my accommodations but I have had a 9am one when I didn’t have class until 3:30pm so to an extent I understand the annoyance.\n\nI get this is frustrating and I hate this class too but I don’t think it’s fair to publicly shame Laura when you haven’t asked for the reason the makeups are at 8am. Tbh I’ve had classes where makeups aren’t offered and you either get a zero or get it excused so this is much better for me lol. 3.091 is the worst class I’ve taken but that is not because of Laura. I can’t say anything about the other aspects of the class \n\nThough, all things said and done, I’m sorry your experience sucks OP 😔",

It does not feel like they want students to succeed at all–I love my recitation instructor but the course admin and lecturers don't feel supportive in the slightest. This semester has sucked and 3.091 has probably been 90% of the reasons why. I wish I had taken this class when I was a freshman."

  "text": "First, I think it's great you've been trying to work through your difficulties. As for your points, the research support for therapy is robust (although it's occasionally challenged in significant ways), but I don't think that evidence needs to be cited here. Even the APA itself acknowledges \"psychotherapy does not work perfectly or for all clients\" (https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0031817), so any trouble you've been having in finding the right support is certainly not your fault. It's possible that there's a therapist out there who could help you a lot, but it could be demoralizing for you to try to find one, especially after your bad experiences with the others. I'd like to give better advice about how you can best be supported, but that kind of feeds in to my next point: any advice I give may be inadequate, especially since I don't know you (or do I? 👀) The only thing I really feel confident recommending is seeking viewpoints from several people you trust, and making sure that you feel listened to and respected by them. One thing I will comment on, although it is personal, is that whenever I go to therapy, I'm not necessarily looking for my therapist to say anything \"smart, eye opening, or useful\". Sometimes I just start talking and find that I'm surprised by what I say, and what it reveals about what I believe or think. Again, it's personal, so maybe you've tried that and it hasn't worked, and that's fine - just wanted to point it out just in case.\n\nAs for your other claim about the industry as a whole, I do think it's unfortunate, and outrageous, that therapy is so expensive. Medical care in general seems to suffer from severe affordability issues. Maybe it's a supply/demand thing - given that there are so few therapists, the cost for their service is necessarily high. But I'm not an economist and I haven't given much thought to it. I would just be hesitant to generalize that all therapists want to suck you dry (OF MONEY, TO BE CLEAR), and that therapy doesn't work unless you believe it does, as you claimed. Maybe I and the other people for whom therapy is effective are just schmucks and we can feel better after talking to our friends. But somehow we don't, which is why we need therapists. And I think it's likely that the kindness showed to you by at least some of the therapists you saw was genuine, because as I understand, many therapists go into therapy and continue being therapists because they want to help people, and they know that their profession is evidence-backed. Which doesn't make it guaranteed to work, but it's as good as we can get.",

  "text": "MIT student turned therapist! The truth is that our industry is very poorly regulated and has very low caliber training. Grad school was a cakewalk, I worked 2 full time jobs and got a 4.0 (this is not a humble brag, this is absolute sad because grad school should feel like you're being challenged and learning, not like I'm paying for a sheet of paper). I have classmates who wrote about using tarot cards in their therapy treatments and passed classes. (Tarot cards are great! Just not evidence based practice!) Our licensing exam is so easy I had friends (who have never taken a therapy course in their lives) try some questions and they would have passed (passing is like a 65% btw). I have worked with more therapists than I can name who are just flat out incompetent. And even worse, they are so so susceptible to Dunning-Kruger effect.\n\nSo no, you are not crazy. A lot of therapists are, simply put, absolutely terrible. It sucks because it leads to people believe that therapy doesn't work for them, when most of the time it's because the therapist is a horrible fit. Even worse is the amount of pseudoscience that invades our field (ask me about EMDR; actually probably best you don't).\n\nPersonally, I believe therapists in general are pretty money-hungry (there, I said it). Insurance will reimburse me $90 to see a patient for 53 minutes (here in Texas; the rates are prob higher in MA), and many therapists think they are above that. My dudes, you went to a 2 year grad school program with bargain bin QA and you don't wanna take $90/hr? Instead you see young therapists, 2-3 years out of grad school, trying to charge $180 via cash pay. Sigh. It really restricts access to treatment and I HATE it.\n\nI could go on and on about his but I'll leave it for now. tl;dr - might not be you, might be them. Keep trying! Took me 6 years to find a therapist that worked for me!",

We dated long distance for 2 years and then he moved across the country for me (and 3 years in, we’re now engaged). If you’re both willing to do it, the things that helped us- 1) talking about long term compatibility relatively early, because you really want to access if the pain/challenges of LDRs are worth it. 2) being crystal clear/both buying in on a timeframe for being back together (for us, 2 years was workable, and we both agreed to work out how to be together in that span). 3) work out how you‘ll stay in touch/see each other- we talked daily (thank god for FaceTime) and tried to see each other every 4-6 weeks. \n\nI hated the long distance relationship part but it was worth it for sure - so, if you really connect and you think you can work it through, I’d say communicate a lot /give it a go",

  "text": "chatGPT: The reason behind the nickname \"Jack\" for a woman with a non-Jack-adjacent name could be that it is a reference to the common phrase \"jack of all trades,\" which is often used to describe someone who is skilled at many different things. It could be that the person who gave you the nickname thinks of you as a versatile and capable individual, hence the association with the phrase.\n\nAnother possibility is that \"Jack\" is simply a shortened version of your name that someone started using and it caught on. Many nicknames don't have a clear connection to the person's given name, but rather are based on other factors like personality traits, physical characteristics, or even inside jokes.\n\nUltimately, the reason behind a nickname is often personal and specific to the individuals involved. If you don't feel comfortable sharing the backstory behind your nickname with others, you could simply say that it's a personal nickname that has stuck over time, without providing further explanation.",

I have given up on providing a sufficient explanation and have started telling people it's a nickname. But then people ask me why my nickname is so different from my actual name.

I have very little memory of undergrad 5 years out, to the point of being shocked to find some classes on my transcript when I applied to grad school, because my depression wasn't sufficiently treated. (this wasn't really MIT mental health's fault - I should've been getting more treatment earlier but didn't think I needed it at the time). taking ADs is generally associated with improvement in cognitive functioning, and ECT, a treatment of last resort should you let your depression fester, definitely messes with cognition and memory. please get the treatment you need now; you won't be creative or smart if you're dead.",

I definitely did, and not by a close call either; I think my cumulative grade in physics was a 49.

  "text": "There is no \"normal\", everybody goes through stuff in their own way. But it's certainly not rare, and it's nothing insurmountable. I failed my share of classes, it's okay.\n\nWhen you're feeling up to it, it's worth considering why it happened. Did you struggle to get your head around the course material? Did you have trouble balancing your workload, and fall behind? Were you \"turned off\" by the subject matter, and couldn't find the motivation to engage with it? Were the classes run in a format you haven't encountered before, and you found it difficult to adapt your learning style to the way it was being taught? There are lots of possible underlying reasons to fail a class. It's worth seeing if you can identify what went wrong, so you can learn from the experience.\n\nRegarding the class you were \"suddenly\" failing: Do you mean you were doing okay, but then an assignment or exam threw you for a loop, and your grade dropped? Or do you mean that you had *thought* you were doing well, and were surprised to find out your grade wasn't as good as you thought it was? If it's the latter, it might be worth talking to the instructor to understand how that happened, and whether there's something you could do to keep from getting unpleasantly surprised like that again.",

I was failing so badly the first time I took it, but when I retook the class, I understood more and had less of a difficult time. I even managed to get a B. So don’t feel stupid.
